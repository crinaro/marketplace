# Changelog

Generated from fixes confirmed shipped — public reports and internal fixes alike, each recorded only after its release tag exists on the published remote. Sections are grouped by plugin, then by version. Newest first.

## jobsearch 0.31.0
- gmail-multi should support send/reply/forward; jobsearch must enforce draft-only as policy rather than rely on the capability being absent *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#213)*
- jobsearch vendors an entire MCP server to use five library functions from it *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#211)*

## jobsearch 0.30.0
- Marketplace identifier: careers-plugins -> crinaro-marketplace, with a launcher self-heal *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#216)*

## jobsearch 0.29.0
- Release: jobsearch 0.29.0 and gmail-multi 0.1.0 — connector self-install replaces the declared dependency *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#210)*
- _root.py hardcodes the marketplace name while install_launcher.py derives it — the two disagree for any non-default catalog *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#199)*

## jobsearch 0.28.0
- [#25](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/25) — Dispatched subagents lack the engine-root pointer/launcher the main run uses to resolve engine files

## jobsearch 0.27.0
- A cover letter carrying a send-hold renders as READY — precondition machinery covers drafts.md only *(tracked internally as crinaro/careers-plugins-dev#169)*
- A staged draft with no matching ask has no guaranteed home in the generated Your Move, so a ready-to-send draft can stay invisible *(tracked internally as crinaro/careers-plugins-dev#154)*
- Prep-note existing-work guard only scans call_preps/, so prep written into kb/ gets re-promised as owed *(tracked internally as crinaro/careers-plugins-dev#153)*
- Generated dashboard has no sourcing/strategy tab; channel status, route, cadence and yield are visible only via scripts *(tracked internally as crinaro/careers-plugins-dev#148)*
- Alert-sweep's aggregator sender list is hardcoded, independent of channel store retirement status *(tracked internally as crinaro/careers-plugins-dev#147)*

## jobsearch 0.26.0
- [#24](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/24) — A user-owned role recorded with a future action date and a sourced/backlog status is invisible on the 'decisions waiting on you' surface until its action date arrives
- [#23](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/23) — record.py's create path leaves the caller to guess a valid record at every stage: --dry-run passes input the real write then refuses, rejection messages name no field, and the fields listing omits enum and type constraints
- [#22](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/22) — The generated-dashboard publish model has a staleness window: the published view can lag committed state via two distinct mechanisms

## jobsearch 0.25.0
- [#21](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/21) — OPEN DESIGN QUESTION: two dashboard views present the same records through two different taxonomies instead of one lifecycle-state view
- [#20](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/20) — Generated dashboard renders knowledge-base and call-preparation artifacts as filename strings, not their content
- [#19](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/19) — No schema field represents a pursued opportunity's post-application play-sequence stage
- [#18](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/18) — A skill mandates an unconditional per-turn re-claim of a session-scoped notification subscription whose delivery cannot be observed by the session
- [#17](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/17) — The write API cannot CREATE a new record, and separately deadlocks when called while the run lock is held, together forcing direct hand-editing of the data store
- [#15](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/15) — The browser automation cannot reach a social platform's secondary/message-requests inbox surface, reproducible across multiple runs
- [#14](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/14) — A validation gate can never pass on a clean install: shipped design docs point at scripts present in no released version
- [#13](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/13) — The weekly reconcile audit again mis-attributes replies and platform events to the wrong sibling outreach row for the same recipient
- [#12](https://github.com/crinaro/careers-plugins/issues/12) — The outbound-click guard's startup selftest fails to open its own transcript path, so every click is classified unresolvable and allowed through instead of blocked

## gmail-multi 0.2.0
- gmail-multi should support send/reply/forward; jobsearch must enforce draft-only as policy rather than rely on the capability being absent *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#213)*

## gmail-multi 0.1.1
- Marketplace identifier: careers-plugins -> crinaro-marketplace, with a launcher self-heal *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#216)*

## gmail-multi 0.1.0
- Release: jobsearch 0.29.0 and gmail-multi 0.1.0 — connector self-install replaces the declared dependency *(tracked internally as crinaro/marketplace-dev#210)*
