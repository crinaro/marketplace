"""The single owner of "which group does this row belong in?" for Your Move. GitHub #79.

⭐ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES
-------------------------
The "needs you" queue used to select rows by OWNERSHIP ALONE: `next_action_owner ==
<candidate> and status in live`. That is a necessary condition, not a sufficient one — a
role future-dated weeks out, one waiting on someone else entirely, and one genuinely overdue
all rendered identically. `next_action_date` was read ONLY as a sort key, never as a cutoff,
and a channel's `next_touch.date` being merely truthy was enough to list it forever, even
after the touch it asked for had already happened.

`generate_dashboard.py` must never re-derive group membership. It imports this module and
renders exactly what `classify_opportunities` / `classify_channels` say.

## Role states, in precedence order

    unresolved   blocked_until is the literal `unresolved`, or unparseable. Its own loud
                 callout — NEVER the primary "needs you" group.
    waiting      blocked_until parses, but no outreach touch to that contact has reached a
                 listed outcome yet.
    scheduled    no unfired trigger, and next_action_date is in the future.
    now          owner is the candidate, status is live, no unfired trigger, and the date is
                 today or in the past (or absent).
    decide       owner is the candidate, status is `backlog`, verdict is `undecided`, no
                 unfired trigger — REGARDLESS of next_action_date. See below.

## ⭐ `decide` — a decision owed is not an action scheduled (dev #142 / public #24)

Issue #79 correctly stopped ownership alone from being the filter: it added the LIVE-status
gate and the date cutoff so future-dated, resolved and other-party-conditional rows stop
cluttering the "needs you" queue. But the restriction also swallowed the intuitive way to
record a NEWLY SOURCED role: `status: backlog` + `verdict: undecided` + the user as owner +
a future act-by date produced a row visible on NO Your Move group, silently.

The two complaints are in tension only if the date is read as the membership key. It is not:
`next_action_date` answers *"when is the action scheduled"*, while this surface asks *"is a
decision owed"*. The schema already distinguishes the two backlog meanings — `verdict:
undecided` (pursue/pass still owed → `decide`, shown with its act-by date as a DEADLINE, not
a reveal date) versus `verdict: parked` (a decided "not now" → stays off the surface, which
is what keeps #79's clutter out). `blocked_until` keeps its full precedence here: an
undecided row genuinely gated on another party is `waiting`/`unresolved`, never `decide`.

## The `blocked_until` field

Grammar is `precondition.py`'s VERBATIM: `contact:<contact_id> outcome:<v>|<v>`, resolved
against the RECORD'S OWN `outreach[]` — never the global pipeline, because a join to another
opportunity's touch would say this role moved when it did not. Plus the literal `unresolved`.
No `date:` form: a time trigger already lives in `next_action_date`, and inventing a second
way to spell the same thing is the exact duplication issue #6 removed for drafts.

## Channel touches are DERIVED, never a hand-authored `last_touch`

`last_touch` is gone from the schema (nothing ever wrote it — see `migrate.py`'s note). A
channel's last touch is computed here, always: the max of (the latest OUTBOUND message in
`messages.jsonl` whose `contact_id` joins any of the channel's `contacts[].contact_id`) and
(the latest `log[]` entry date).

⭐ THE FULFILMENT RULE'S SHARP EDGE. A derived touch dated ON OR AFTER `next_touch.date`
fulfils the plan. An EARLIER touch does NOT — the row stays `now`, because the cheap error is
a look at a handled row and the expensive one is a phantom fulfilment cancelling a call that
is still owed.

`next_touch` itself gets no mechanical write path here, deliberately: it is a plan authored
by judgement (`record.py`), and nothing in this module ever advances or clears it.
