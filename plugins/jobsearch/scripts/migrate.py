"""Apply profile migrations when the engine version moves. Idempotent; safe to run every session.

Since marketplace issue #11 this is also the startup home of the INSTALL self-heal
(`heal_install.py`, adr-014): the same `SessionStart` hook keeps both the user's data and their
install current with the running version, and neither ever asks the user to run a command.

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS
------------------
0.4.0 retired two `focus.md` sections. Shipping that as "run this script" put the work on every
installer, who would have to know the migration existed at all — **that does not scale past the
one person who happened to read the release note.** A plugin that changes the shape of a user's
data has to carry the change with it.

## ⭐⭐ THE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERY MIGRATION HERE: SAFE APPLIES, DESTRUCTIVE REPORTS.

A migration runs unattended, at session start, on data this engine does not own. So:

    SAFE         idempotent, and losslessly reversible from git -> APPLIED automatically.
    DESTRUCTIVE  could discard something recorded nowhere else -> REPORTED, never applied.

The retired-sections migration is the exact case: removing two dead headings is safe, **but not
if `🔧 Open` still holds items nobody filed** — those exist in no other place, and deleting them
at session start would be silent data loss the user never asked for. So it refuses and says what
to do. `retire_process_sections.py` already encodes that judgement; this runner defers to it.

⚠️ **FAILS OPEN, ALWAYS.** A migration that errors must never block a session — the user would be
locked out of their own search by a housekeeping step. Every failure path exits 0 and says so.

⚠️ **RESOLVES THE PROFILE FROM THE CURRENT DIRECTORY ONLY — never the remembered pointer.** The
pointer exists so a process with no cwd can still find the profile, which is exactly wrong here:
a session running in the ENGINE repo would otherwise resolve the user's profile and migrate it
from a session that has no business touching it. No profile under cwd means nothing to do.

The stamp lives in the PROFILE (`.jobsearch-schema`), because it records what has been done to
THIS user's data, not what version of the engine happens to be installed.

Usage:
    python3 migrate.py --check     # what is pending; writes nothing
    python3 migrate.py             # apply the safe ones, report the rest
    python3 migrate.py --hook      # same, but silent when there is nothing to say

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.

    `kb/` filenames were free-form and drifted; dated call-prep notes joined to nothing; the
    promote-before-archive rule lived only in prose. `knowledge.py` now resolves three fields
    (`**Company:**`, `**Companies:**`, `**Promoted:**`) against the data model, and this
    migration marks every pre-existing file so a gap reports as `unresolved` — never as absent,
    and never as fine. Same shape as m_0_18_0; fires when the engine version reaches 0.19.0.

    ⭐ PRESERVE, THEN TRANSFORM — nothing is renamed, moved, or deleted. Files gain one or two
    marker lines; existing content is untouched, so every drifted kb file stays exactly where
    its owner knows it, just LOUDLY unjoined until someone structures the join.

    The one join written confidently: a kb filename that equals a company id after separator
    normalization (`Bluewater_Grid.md` → `bluewater-grid`) gets its `**Company:**` field —
    deterministic, not a guess. A business-unit-vs-parent mismatch or a no-match filename gets
    `unresolved`: guessing that join would file one organization's intel under another,
    which is the same store-that-answers-wrongly this whole issue is about.

    Additive and idempotent: files already carrying a field are skipped. SAFE by this module's
    rule — inserts lines, deletes nothing, reversible from git.

def m_0_25_0_focus_retirement(profile, apply_it):
    """0.25.0 — focus.md is retired as a source of state (dev #93 / public #21).

    The owner's call: "Keep the tabs and remove the use of focus.md, use the data in the
    json files." The verified failure behind it: a record hand-copied into focus.md's
    action-needed list duplicated its auto-rendered row and went stale, still claiming
    action was needed after it was not. The dashboard keeps both tabs; their content moves
    to stores a view cannot disagree with:

        ## ⚡ Your Move (numbered items)      -> data/asks.jsonl        kind=role
        ## ⚙️ Process — ⚡ Needs … (items)    -> data/asks.jsonl        kind=system
        ## 📅 This Week (items/bullets)      -> data/commitments.jsonl (unparseable date ->
                                                the literal `unresolved`, LOUD downstream)
        ## 🔗 Session Handoff                -> handoff.md — narrative for the next session,
                                                deliberately NOT forced into JSONL: a letter
                                                is not a record, and the stores it points at
                                                are already queryable.
        anything else with real content      -> appended to process_archive.md, stamped

    ⭐⭐ PRESERVE, THEN TRANSFORM — in that order, mechanically. Every relocation is written
    and verified BEFORE focus.md is touched; a failure part-way leaves content in BOTH
    places (recoverable), never in neither. A migration that refused because content would
    be lost has not shipped (this repo's own Process-section lesson); nothing here refuses.
    Finally focus.md is replaced with a frozen stub naming the new homes, which is also the
    idempotency marker: a stubbed file migrates to nothing on every later run. Ask and
    commitment ids are content-derived (a short hash), so even a re-run against a restored
    focus.md cannot duplicate rows. The two stores are created (empty) even when focus.md is
    absent — doctor.py asserts their existence, and an absent store must mean "not migrated
    yet", never "migrated on a profile that happened to have no focus.md".

    (dev #151).

    `diagnostics.log` and `drift/` were machine-global and keyed by SESSION, so two profiles
    on one machine interleaved in one file with no way to separate them — which made
    `guard_status()`'s own question ("has THIS install had an inert guard for two days?")
    unanswerable the moment a second profile existed. The line that holds: per-profile STATE
    belongs with the profile; only what is needed to FIND a profile (`run`, `profile_root`,
    `engine_root`) stays under `$HOME`. Those three are deliberately untouched.

    ⭐ PRESERVE, THEN TRANSFORM. `diagnostics.log` is the store `doctor`/`whoami` read for
    guard status, so its rows are merged into `<profile>/.jobsearch/diagnostics.log` — global
    rows first, then any the new code already wrote there — and the source is removed only
    after the destination is verified readable. The rows carry no identifiers by `_diag.py`'s
    own contract, so with one known profile they are all attributable to it; a second profile
    migrating later finds nothing left to claim and no-ops. `drift/` markers move the same
    way. `.jobsearch/` is added to the profile's `.gitignore`: the state is machine-local and
    data-free, and committing ring-buffer churn would pollute every commit.

    Retiring an aggregator channel in the store used to have no effect on the daily alert
    sweep, because the retirement decision (`relationship_status`) and the sweep's source list
    (a Python constant) lived in two disconnected places. `alert_sweep.py` now derives its

    retired` automatically — a data decision that no longer needs an engine edit.

    contains one of the six sender keywords the old constant hardcoded (indeed / linkedin /

    (public #28; layout table in `_tree.py`, THE one definition this shares with the
    resolver and the `--audit` check).

    The directory tree is a PRIMARY interface — the candidate browses the markdown in the
    desktop app — and it accumulated instead of being designed: ~25 entries at root mixing
    six categories, an application worksheet misfiled into interview prep because applying
    had no home, retirement existing only as prose, and generated output sitting beside
    hand-edited sources. Every move here comes from `_tree.LAYOUT`; nothing is hardcoded
    twice.

    ⭐ PRESERVE, THEN TRANSFORM, mechanically:
      - A move happens only when the destination slot is free; a same-name conflict is
        MERGED for authored markdown (legacy content appended under a stamped heading —
        nothing lost, loudly visible), and resolved keep-canonical for GENERATED files
        (dashboard artifacts are re-derivable by construction).
      - `application_batch_*.md` files found in the prep directory move to `applying/` —
        #28's clearest symptom, the worksheet filed into the nearest adjacent category.
      - RETIREMENT BECOMES A MOVE: a root `focus.md` / `opportunities.md` (both frozen by
        the rulebook, both still live-looking in every listing) goes to
        `archive/retired-trackers/`.
      - A root `nonexistent/` holding only empty directories (the unresolved-placeholder
        signature, #28 item 7) is removed — deleting empty directories loses nothing; one
        holding anything real is moved to `archive/` instead, never deleted.
      - THE UNION IS RENAMED ON THE MOVE: `resume.md` -> `presence/claims.md` (ADR-018's
        deferred question, settled by the owner with public #28 — the old name asserted a
        printed artifact; this is the superset nobody sends, and `claims` is the word the
        variant gate and the docs already use).
      - Declared variant pages move with the union: `data/resume_variants.jsonl` rows whose
        `file` moved get the field rewritten to the new relative path, value-preserving —
        including a row that declared the union itself, which follows the rename.

    ⭐ Scripts resolve every one of these paths through `_tree.path()`, which falls back to
    the legacy location — so a profile this migration has not reached (a failed-open run, a
    cloud checkout mid-window) keeps WORKING, while `_tree.py --audit` keeps SAYING it is
    unmigrated. A missing thing must never read as an empty thing.

    Idempotent: a second run finds every legacy slot empty and no-ops. History is moved,
    never rewritten — log.md, process_archive.md and the archives keep their content
    byte-for-byte; only their location changes where the structure requires it.

    drift by comparing the schema stamp against the ENGINE VERSION, which is a different
    question and has a different answer: the stamp only advances when a migration exists,
    while the version advances on every release. After 0.21.0 and 0.22.0 — neither carrying
    a migration — a correct, fully-migrated profile sat legitimately at 0.20.0, and the
    guard warned on every prompt of every session about a condition no action could clear.
    Running the remedy it named printed "profile is current" and changed nothing.

    That is the exact failure the guard exists to prevent: a warning that always fires is
    one its reader learns to dismiss, so the release that DOES carry a migration produces a
    signal indistinguishable from the noise. Worse, it sent the reader to a script whose own
    output contradicted it, with nothing saying which was wrong.

    Both now read this. They cannot disagree, because there is only one answer.
