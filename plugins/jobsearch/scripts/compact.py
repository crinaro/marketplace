RETENTION — the periodic cleanup for append-only data.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02: *"With append only, how is the data periodically cleaned up?"*

A fair question, and the honest answer at the time was **nothing did**. `inbox.py --prune` existed
but no run ever called it, and `log.md` had reached **956 KB / 140,000 words** with no retention
path whatsoever — re-committed in full on every one of the (now 2-hourly) runs.

Append-only is the right shape for correctness — it is what removed the clobber race on
`data/inbox.jsonl`, where a whole-file rewrite could silently destroy a concurrent append. But
append-only without compaction is just a leak with good intentions. **Compaction is the other half
of the design, and it belongs on a schedule.**

## The policy, per artifact — and the reasoning, not just the number

| artifact | policy | why |
|---|---|---|
| `data/inbox.jsonl` | drop **acked** findings older than 30d | A handled finding has already been written into real state; the queue row is a receipt, not the record |
| `log.md` | roll entries older than **120d** into `archive/log_<year>.md` | Runs read the TAIL, never the whole file; but git re-commits all 956 KB every run |
| `data/messages.jsonl` | **never pruned** | It IS the evidence base for "which communications work". Deleting it would delete the answer |
| `data/opportunities.jsonl` | **never pruned** | Closed roles stay: `sightings[]` feed channel yield, and every `company_id`/`channel_id` FK must keep resolving |
| `docs/incident_archive.md`, `process_archive.md` | **never pruned** | Already the cold tier. Pruning cold storage is just deletion |

**Nothing here deletes anything that is still evidence.** Only receipts and old narrative move, and
narrative moves rather than disappearing.

## Safety

Rewriting a file races any concurrent append, which is the exact bug this whole design exists to
avoid. So **this takes the write lock and refuses if it cannot get it.**

⚠️ **`--holding-lock` exists because the original design contradicted itself and never once ran.**
This docstring used to say it "is invoked from the weekly review, which already holds the lock" —
and the weekly review DOES hold it, which made `--take` fail every single time. Verified
2026-08-02 by running it mid-review: exit 1, `REFUSED`, zero bytes compacted, and the refusal text
blamed a phantom concurrent writer. **The one caller it was written for could never call it.**
So a caller that already owns the lock passes `--holding-lock`: compaction proceeds without taking
it, and does NOT release it — the lock stays the caller's to release, on whatever schedule the
caller's own window follows (the weekly review holds a narrow window around this call and
`archive_preps.py`, released before the strategist dispatch — public #68 — then opens a second,
separate window later for its own commit). Without a lock held by anyone, the flag is refused
rather than treated as a bypass.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/compact.py --dry-run       # what would move, and how much
    python3 scripts/compact.py                 # do it (takes and releases the lock itself)
    python3 scripts/compact.py --holding-lock  # caller already owns the lock (the weekly review)

    `log.md` is append-only BY RULE — past entries are never edited. Moving a whole entry to a
    dated archive is not an edit; it is the same treatment `process_archive.md` already gives
    `focus.md`. The entries stay readable and stay in git history either way.

    TWO RULES, because age alone did not solve the problem it was written for. The age rule
    (`cutoff`, 120d) keeps recent narrative readable. But the stated motivation was that git
    re-commits the whole file on every 2-hourly run, and **that cost is real and was measured,
    not assumed: on 2026-08-02, `git rev-list --objects HEAD -- log.md | git cat-file
    --batch-check` reported 414 blob versions of log.md occupying 78.2 MB — just under HALF of
    the 163 MB .git.** A 120-day rule cannot touch a 26-day-old repo, so the policy as first
    written would have compacted nothing until ~November while that 78 MB kept growing.

    So: after the age pass, if the file still exceeds `max_bytes`, keep rolling the OLDEST
    remaining entries until it fits — but NEVER one newer than `floor_cutoff`. The floor wins
    over the budget. An over-budget file whose entries are all recent is left over-budget and
    reported honestly, rather than eating narrative the runs may still need.
