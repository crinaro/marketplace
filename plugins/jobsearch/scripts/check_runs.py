"""Did the scheduled runs actually DO anything? (Not: did the scheduler fire them?)

⭐⭐ THE DISTINCTION THIS EXISTS FOR — the candidate noticed it before the system did.
On 2026-08-06 `search-daily` reported `lastRunAt` 09:08 and the scheduler considered it a
success. It had left **no footprint at all**: no `log.md` entry, no inbox post, no commit. The
07:08 run had done all three. The 09:08 run fired, died early, and updated `lastRunAt` on its way
out — most likely at its first script call, because the engine pointer was aimed at a per-session
plugin copy that had gone away.

    ⭐ `lastRunAt` RECORDS THAT A RUN STARTED, NOT THAT IT ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING. A run that dies
      in its first ten seconds is indistinguishable, from the scheduler's side, from one that
      swept two mailboxes and found nothing. **And "no new findings" looks exactly like "no runs"
      to the person reading the summary** — which is why this went unnoticed until a human asked.

So the scheduler is not the source of truth here; the repo is. This script asks the only question
that matters: **when did a run last leave evidence?**

⚠️ It cannot see `lastRunAt` — that lives behind an MCP tool no script can call. That is
deliberate division of labour: this reports the FOOTPRINT, the coordinator compares it against
`list_scheduled_tasks`, and **a gap between the two is the finding.** Neither half is conclusive
alone, and the coordinator skill says so.

Advisory: ALWAYS exits 0, so it can never wedge an unattended run.

Usage:
    python3 check_runs.py            # human summary
    python3 check_runs.py --json     # for the coordinator to compare against the scheduler

    # ⭐ GitHub #7 — THE THIRD STATE. A run can advance `lastRunAt` while never creating a
    # session at all: no log entry, no commit, nothing. From outside that is identical to a quiet
    # run, and every automated signal reads green. It was caught only because a human noticed the
    # sweep's effects were absent and went looking for the session.
    #
    # The journal's `start` event is the evidence a session EXISTED, written before any work.
    # With it, the three states finally separate:
    #
    #     lastRunAt advanced, no `start`          -> NEVER STARTED        (#7)
    #     `start` with no `end`                   -> started and died     (#4)
    #     `start` + `end`, footprint may be empty -> ran; quiet is normal
    #
    # ⚠️ This is NOT a fix for the scheduler recording a run that did not happen — that is Claude
    # Code's, and nothing here can change it. What is ours is refusing to treat `lastRunAt` as
    # evidence that a run occurred, because it is not evidence of that.
    #
    # ⭐⭐ public #65 — #7's OWN FIX HAD A RESIDUAL GAP. `start` is written by the RUN'S OWN
    # LOGIC — a skill instruction, the model's second action — so a session that IS created and
    # dies before that instruction ever executes still leaves no `start`, and is STILL
    # indistinguishable from "the scheduler never invoked a session at all." `journal.py --fired`
    # closes that gap: it is written by the SessionStart HOOK ITSELF, deterministically, before
    # any model turn (see hooks.json). That splits the old "no start" bucket into two real states:
    #
    #     lastRunAt advanced, no `fired` at all    -> genuinely never invoked (#65's hard case —
    #                                                  now distinguishable from every row below)
    #     `fired`, no `start` ever followed        -> the hook ran; the model turn that should
    #                                                  have called --start never completed
    #     `start` with no `end`                    -> the run itself began and died (#4)
