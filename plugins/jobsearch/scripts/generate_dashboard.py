"""Generate the published state views from the operating store.

Deterministic, zero-token rendering: the model maintains data/*.jsonl (and the few
human-facing .md artifacts — drafts, cover letters, network); this script assembles the
HTML. Since dev #93 focus.md is not read at all: Your Move and This Week are
views of data/asks.jsonl, data/commitments.jsonl, opportunities.jsonl and channels.jsonl —
plus, since dev #154, the staged-message pair (drafts.md / cover_letters.md via
precondition.report) for the ready-no-ask group; the Sourcing tab (dev #148) is a view of
channels.jsonl + opportunities.jsonl sightings through channels_due.py's derivations.

⭐⭐ THE PUBLISHING MODEL — dev #233 (with public #27), 2026-08-25.
MEASURED on a live profile: the old single dashboard was 639 KB for 63 table rows,
because drafts, cover letters and knowledge artifacts rendered IN FULL into what is
otherwise a state view (knowledge 328 KB, staged messages 129 KB, CSS 18 KB). A page
that size is not a phone surface, and a second local copy (dashboard.html, 159 bytes
apart from the artifact) was a staleness window nothing kept closed (public #22).

The split is by PURPOSE: an artifact is a snapshot — right for "what is true now",
structurally wrong for "work through this". So:

  dashboard_artifact.html            the six-tab STATE view. Documents render as
                                     title + status + location, NEVER in full.
  views/router_artifact.html         one bounded row per phase (configure · presence ·
                                     pipeline · applying · conversations · outreach)
                                     with the next action and a count — the page that
                                     opens on a phone (D2).
  views/phase-pipeline_artifact.html the opportunity list in detail + company knowledge.
  views/phase-conversations_...html  the week + call preps in full (public #20's need:
                                     a call prep readable the night before, anywhere).
  views/phase-outreach_...html       every PENDING message in full — the reading
                                     surface for approval ("the candidate reads the
                                     full text off the published page, not the
                                     transcript"). Sent messages have no entry left,
                                     so this page is bounded by pending volume.
  dashboard.html                     a constant TOMBSTONE STUB. The local full copy is
                                     retired; a stub carries no state, so the old
                                     two-copies staleness window is gone BY
                                     CONSTRUCTION, not by a check.

⭐ EVERY output above is written on EVERY run — nothing is conditional on volume, so a
page can never linger stale because this profile's shape shifted. What the volume
threshold selects is the PUBLISH SET: a phase page is worth its own published artifact
when its item count strictly exceeds its equal share of all phase items (total across
the six phases / 6) — a function of this profile's own distribution, never a constant
wearing a formula. The summary line names the selection; the session publishes those.

The working surface for applying is NOT here and not an artifact at all — it is
views/applying.md (applying.py), regenerated in session, because working means writing
and a snapshot cannot be written to.

# so there is no prose section left to parse: `asks_from_jsonl()` below is the replacement,
# and check_action_claims.py reads the same store instead of re-parsing this file's output.


# `render_fit()` lived here until 2026-08-13 and was NEVER CALLED. It rendered exactly the
# open questions the coordinator points readers at, so its presence made the feature look

# behaviour now lives in `_fit_detail`, which is the renderer that actually runs.

# THE OPPORTUNITY ROW — one role, one place.
#
# ⭐⭐ WHY THIS REPLACED FIVE SECTIONS (2026-08-10).
#
# The Opportunities tab used to render the same roles five times: a JD-fit register, three
# application buckets (submitted / in play through a person / nothing sent), a focus-areas list
# and a sourced-pipeline table. Measured against the live pipeline: **every one of the 46 live
# roles appeared in at least two of those sections, 16 appeared in four, and not one appeared in
# exactly one.** Answering "where does this role stand" meant reading four tables and joining
# them by company name in your head.
#
# The cause was not too much content. It was that the tab was organised by ATTRIBUTE — fit,
# application state, focus, source — while the reader's unit of thought is the ROLE.
#
# ⭐ THE FIX IS STRUCTURAL, NOT COSMETIC. Bucket membership becomes a POSITION rather than a
# table you are listed in. `stage` already exists on every record, so the rail below shows where
# a role actually is; the three application buckets become a filter over one list instead of
# three copies of it. A status CHIP would not have done this — a chip shows state but not
# progression, and it would have left all four tables standing.
#
# Everything the old sections showed is still here. Each fact now appears once.

    document: the <an employer> entry has two recipients, each with a connection note AND a follow-up
    message, and all four bodies merged into one undifferentiated wall with no way to tell which
    text goes to whom or which piece is which. `### Recipient 1 of 2` and `#### A. / B.` headings
    were dropped outright, so the only signposts vanished too.

    **And free prose was silently discarded** — drafts.md's own header warns about this
    ("Free-form prose paragraphs without a `**Label:**` prefix are silently dropped... verified

    # Every staged draft used to render under "awaiting your approval to send", including part-B
    # messages that cannot go until the recipient accepts. One observed state showed seven items
    # as needing the candidate, of which ONE was actionable. That inverts the surface: a Your Move line has
    # to be a question or an imperative aimed at them, and a draft they cannot send is neither — so
    # padding the list is how the one list that must be unskippable stops being read.
    #
    # The precondition is now DATA (`**Blocked until:** contact:<id> outcome:a|b`), resolved
    # against the outreach `outcome` that already existed. Falls back to treating everything as
    # sendable if the resolver cannot run: a dashboard that renders is worth more than one that
    # is right about grouping, and the old behaviour is the safe direction to fail in.
    # ⭐ GitHub issue #13 — group by precondition.NOT_SENDABLE, never by a literal comparison.
    # `state != "blocked"` treated `unreadable` (and would have treated `unresolved`, the
    # legacy-prose state) as sendable, so a draft the resolver could NOT vouch for rendered
    # under "awaiting your approval to send". The set of states that must never read as "needs
    # you" is precondition.py's to own; this only consumes it. A draft the resolver did not
    # report at all still defaults to sendable — that is the render-over-grouping fallback above.
