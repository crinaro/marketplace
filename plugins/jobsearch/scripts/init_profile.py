"""Scaffold a NEW user's job-search profile. The deterministic half of onboarding.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-05)
----------------------------
The owner: *"the goal is to support this running on the lowest Claude subscription and someone
could have a job search assistant."* Onboarding has two halves, and only one of them needs a model:

  * SCAFFOLDING — create the files, the schema-valid empty stores, the config skeleton, the
    directory layout. Pure mechanism. **This script. Costs nothing.**
  * ELICITATION — read their resume, ask what is missing, learn the facts they would not think to
    write down. Genuinely conversational. **The `onboarding` skill.**

Doing the mechanical half in Python is not an optimisation, it is the difference between an
onboarding a low-tier user can afford and one they cannot (ADR-008).

⚠️ THIS SCRIPT NEVER TOUCHES CREDENTIALS. Mailbox passwords go in the OS keychain by the user's
own hand; the engine must not handle them (CLAUDE.md standing rule). It writes a checklist, not a
secret.

⚠️ IT REFUSES TO OVERWRITE. A populated profile is someone's search history. `--force` is
deliberately absent: if a file exists, this says so and stops.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/init_profile.py --check          # what exists, what is missing
    python3 scripts/init_profile.py --scaffold       # create what is missing
    python3 scripts/init_profile.py --scaffold --posture full

Python 3.9+, stdlib only.

The engine never stores, reads, or transmits a password. These are steps only you can do.

## 1. Mailbox (IMAP) — needed for application receipts and recruiter mail

Use an APP PASSWORD, never your account password.

- Gmail: enable 2FA, then create an app password at myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- Store it in your OS keychain under service `claudesearch-imap`, account = your address:

      security add-generic-password -s claudesearch-imap -a you@example.com -w   # macOS

- Add the address to `user.json` -> `mailboxes`.

**If you skip this:** the assistant cannot see application receipts, recruiter replies, or
calendar invites. It still works from what you tell it, but you become the only sensor.

## 2. LinkedIn — needed for the outreach half of the funnel

There is no API. It requires a real logged-in browser on a desktop, via the Claude in Chrome
extension. Sign in to Chrome, install the extension, sign in to the extension.

**⚠️ This is the one part that cannot move to a phone or the cloud** (docs/adr-006). If you have
no desktop, everything else still works; LinkedIn simply will not be swept.

## 3. Nothing else

No API keys, no tokens, no third-party services. If something asks you for one, it is not part of
this system.
