"""The per-company knowledge stores, joined to the pipeline. Resolves against the data model.

⭐ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (GitHub issue #12)
-------------------------------------------
The profile has two places for durable, accumulating knowledge about a target organization —
`kb/<company_id>.md` and the dated `call_preps/call_prep_<date>.md` notes — and neither
accumulated reliably, for three structural reasons:

1. **NO JOIN.** The kb filename was free-form, so nothing connected a pipeline row to its
   accumulated history or back. In a live profile the naming drifted silently (a business unit
   where the id names the parent, a different word separator) and no check noticed, because no
   check existed.
2. **PREP NOTES ARE KEYED BY DATE.** One dated file holds conversations with unrelated
   organizations; a second conversation with the SAME organization lands under an unrelated
   filename. Assembling one relationship's history required already knowing the dates — exactly
   what the store was supposed to remember.
3. **THE PROMOTION PATH WAS PROSE.** "Promote durable content to the kb BEFORE archiving"
   existed only as narrative, so nothing detected a prep archived without promotion, and the kb
   never grew.

This is the fourth instance of one defect — ⭐ A FACT A RUN KNOWS GOES INTO THE QUERYABLE STORE,
NEVER INTO NARRATIVE — and it copies the established shape (`act_by`, `precondition.py`,
`m_0_18_0`) rather than inventing a fifth: a named field, a strict parser that refuses what it
cannot read, and a resolver against data that already exists.

## ⚠️ Why prep notes STAY date-keyed — the reversal is deliberate, and this module respects it

Organization-named prep notes were already tried: `call_prep_<company>.md` lived at the repo
root, and `generate_dashboard.py`'s docstring still records one being promoted to
`kb/<company>.md`. On 2026-08-03 the candidate directly asked for the current form — preps go
stale as DOCUMENTS long before their content does, one day's file can cover several unrelated
calls, so live preps are date-keyed in `call_preps/` and durable content is promoted to the
org-keyed `kb/`. A regression test (`test_promoted_kb_knowledge_survived`) guards that
retirement. **So the fix here is a recorded JOIN from the dated note to the organizations it
discusses — never a re-keying of the note itself.**

## The fields

kb file (`kb/*.md`) — the filename stem IS the join when it equals a `companies.jsonl` id;
otherwise the file must carry one, on its own line:

    **Company:** company:<company_id>

call-prep note (`call_preps/*.md`) — which organizations this day's conversations concern:

    **Companies:** company:<id> company:<id> channel:<channel_id>
    **Companies:** none                      # explicitly: no tracked organization

(`channel:<id>` covers a call with a recruiting firm that is a channel, not a target company —
resolved against `data/channels.jsonl`, so a firm call needs no fake company row.)

archived prep (`archive/call-preps/*.md`) — the promotion, recorded at archive time:

    **Promoted:** kb:<company_id> on <date>  # one kb: token per file that received content
    **Promoted:** nothing-durable            # explicitly: reviewed, nothing worth keeping

A `kb:<id>` claim is verified: the id must resolve AND `kb/<id>.md` must exist non-empty —
a promotion whose target is missing or empty lost its content, and says so loudly.

## States

    joined / promoted / none / nothing-durable   resolved against the data model
    unresolved   known gap, not yet structured — what `migrate.py`'s 0.19.0 migration marks,
                 and what a file with no field and no resolving filename reports as
    unreadable   a field nobody can parse, or an id that resolves to nothing — LOUD, never
                 guessed over (a store that looks populated and answers nothing is the whole
                 failure this module closes)
    missing      an active pursuit at a conversation stage (screening/interviewing/offer)
                 with no joined kb file — the accumulation the run must perform

⚠️ `--check` fails on `unreadable` and `unresolved`. It does NOT fail on `missing`: the gate
would trip the moment a stage advances, BEFORE the run that creates the file can act, and wedge
the very run that fixes it. `missing` is reported with the exact path to create instead.

Usage:
    python3 knowledge.py            # every store row: state + why
    python3 knowledge.py --json
    python3 knowledge.py --check    # exit 1 on an unreadable or unresolved join/promotion

    Before this, the daily-run guard only ran `ls call_preps/` — so prep material that had
    already been PROMOTED into `kb/<company_id>.md` (this module's own `**Promoted:**` flow,
    the accumulation `report()` above already tracks) read as "nothing written yet" and got
    re-promised as owed across multiple runs. There are exactly THREE places prep for one
    company can be sitting, all of them already known to this module because it resolves
    joins against every one of them:

      1. `kb/<company_id>.md`     — promoted durable knowledge (kb_rows)
      2. `call_preps/*.md`        — a live, not-yet-archived dated note (prep_rows)
      3. `archive/call-preps/*.md` (and the legacy `archive/call_preps/` spelling) — an
         already-archived dated note (archived_prep_rows / ARCHIVE_DIRS)

    Established by reading this module end to end, not guessed: `report()` already builds
    rows from all three, and `pursuit_rows()` already leans on `kb_rows`'s `joined` set as
    the authority for "does this company have somewhere prep accumulates." Adding `kb/` and
    stopping there would have been the SAME defect one file later — the register's own
    warning — so this checks all three, and stays the one place that decides "has this
    company's prep already been written," so a future fourth store only needs adding HERE.

    A kb file counts only non-empty (an empty `kb/<id>.md` was never actually written into).
    A call-prep note (live or archived) counts if a `company:<company_id>` token appears
    anywhere in its `**Companies:**` line — deliberately not requiring the WHOLE line to
    resolve cleanly, so one unreadable id alongside a valid one doesn't hide a real hit.

    Returns the list of relative paths that already carry this company's prep (empty = no
    existing prep found anywhere; a guard treats that, and only that, as "still owed").

    The scan itself lives in `prep_hits()` below — this stays the compatibility face of the
    same single predicate (paths only, company kind), so nothing that consumes it re-derives
