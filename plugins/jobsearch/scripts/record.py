"""
THE WRITE API for the mutable data files — one code path, a lock held in milliseconds.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-04: *"do we have the locks on the appropriate items? … if we had processes
that are reused (atomic) that will make sense but the challenge is a process putting something on
the queue for another."*

The candidate was right, and an audit made the reason precise. The repo already runs **two** concurrency
strategies and they were mixed up:

    APPEND + REPLAY   data/inbox.jsonl · data/pending_actions.jsonl · messages.jsonl
                      Lock-free BY DESIGN. Two workers append at once and replay resolves it.
                      **These have never conflicted.** The queue hand-off the candidate worried
                      about is the part that already works.

    WHOLE-FILE REWRITE  opportunities.jsonl (167 rows) · companies.jsonl · channels.jsonl
                      Every mutation was an AD-HOC `read all → mutate → write all`, invented
                      fresh by whatever session happened to be editing. **There was no write
                      API at all.**

**That is why the lock had to be coarse.** You cannot make a file safe when any session may
rewrite it however it likes; the only defence left is a global mutex held across the whole
edit. So the lock grew to cover a verify-and-write cycle lasting minutes, and the observed cost
was four false-RED gate sweeps in a single afternoon plus a duplicated LinkedIn record.

**This collapses the window.** One code path takes the lock, reads, mutates, writes atomically,
and releases — milliseconds, not minutes. The lock stops being a convention that every session
must remember and becomes correct by construction.

## ⭐ THE WRITE IS ATOMIC, AND THAT IS NOT DECORATION

Writes go to a temp file in the same directory and are `os.replace`d into place, which is atomic
on POSIX. A partial write to `opportunities.jsonl` would corrupt **167 records** — the entire
pipeline — and the old ad-hoc pattern (`open(p,'w')` then loop) had exactly that failure mode if
a session died mid-loop. Nothing recovers that but a git checkout.

## What it does NOT solve, stated plainly

Two workers editing the **same record** still serialise. This shrinks the contention window; it
does not make concurrent edits to one row commutative. If that turns out to happen in practice,
the answer is journaling the store the way the queues are journaled — but that is a data-model
migration and should wait for evidence, not a guess.

## ⭐ CALLING THIS MID-RUN: `--already-locked` (public #17 / dev #97)

The daily run takes the run lock itself at the top of its write phase and releases after the
commit. Called inside that window, this script used to try to take the same lock AGAIN — and
since the holder was the caller's own run, it waited out the full timeout for a release that
could never come. The observed result was the exact failure this API exists to prevent:
sessions gave up and hand-edited the JSONL.

So the contract is now explicit, and it does not touch the two-strategy design above:

    OUTSIDE a lock-holding run   plain call — takes the lock, writes, releases (milliseconds).
    INSIDE the run's write phase pass `--already-locked` — the write proceeds under the RUN's
                                 hold; nothing here takes or releases. Verified, not trusted:
                                 if nobody actually holds the lock the call is REFUSED, because
                                 a caller claiming a hold that does not exist is writing
                                 unprotected by accident.

A refused take now also diagnoses the self-deadlock instead of leaving a silent wait: the
default `--wait` is seconds (holders release in seconds by design), and the refusal says when
`--already-locked` is the answer.

## ⭐ COMPLETING AN ACTION RESOLVES ITS ASK, IN THE SAME WRITE (dev #133 / public #22)

An ask in data/asks.jsonl that carries `resolves_when` ("application" | "outreach") plus
`opp_id` has declared which recorded action answers it. When this API lands that action on that
opportunity, the ask is resolved under the same lock hold — one transaction, no drift window.
Asks without the declaration are never touched (guessing closes still-needed questions);
check_action_claims.py remains the detection backstop for them.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/record.py create <opp_id> '{"company_id":"...","title":"...", ...}'
    python3 scripts/record.py set <opp_id> stage screening
    python3 scripts/record.py set <opp_id> next_action_owner <candidate>   # e.g. your own name, lowercased
    python3 scripts/record.py set-in <opp_id> outreach contact_id=jane-doe outcome replied
    python3 scripts/record.py append <opp_id> research_log '{"date":"2026-08-04","note":"..."}'
    python3 scripts/record.py show <opp_id>
    ... --file companies|channels to address the other stores. --dry-run to preview.
    ... --already-locked when the calling run already holds the run lock (see above).

    validate().

    ⭐ THIS is the fix for dev #143 / public #23 failure #1: a dry-run create on an enum-invalid
    or wrongly-typed field used to report success, because --dry-run only ran check_field's
    unknown-key/required checks and stopped — it never ran validate_data.py, which is the ONLY
    thing that catches an enum violation or a value of the wrong shape. The identical input as
    a real write was refused and rolled back. A green dry-run that does not predict the real
    write is worse than no dry-run at all, so dry-run now runs the SAME validator, not a lesser
    one.

    ⭐ THE SHADOW IS SHAPED LIKE THE PROFILE, NOT LIKE A BAG OF JSONL (public #61, 0.37.1).
    The first version copied the `*.jsonl` files into a FLAT temp dir and pointed the
    validator at it. validate_data.py resolves AUTHORED files — a declared resume variant's
    page — off `dirname(DATA)`, the profile root; in a flat shadow that parent is the temp
    dir itself, so every declared variant's file-existence check failed and a dry run of a
    NO-OP write (a date field assigned the value it already held) printed that a real write
    would be refused, naming files that existed and were readable. One-directional: the real
    write validates against the real profile and succeeds, so the store was never corrupted —
    what broke was the ability to check anything before writing, and every message looked
    like a legitimate validation failure. Dormant from dev #143's shadow until a variant was
    declared.

    So the shadow is now `<tmp>/data/` with every NON-data sibling of the real data dir
    symlinked into `<tmp>/`: the validator's `dirname(DATA)` lands on a directory whose
    contents ARE the profile root's, and any future authored-file check resolves correctly
    with no second override for every fresh-install path to honour. The validator only reads,
    so a symlink is exactly as safe as the real file. (The repo rule against committed
    symlinks is about TRACKED files, which dangle in every clone; these live in a temp dir
    for one subprocess and are gone with it — they are never tracked.) A symlink failure
    raises rather than falling back to the flat shape: a shadow that silently regressed to
    the flat layout would reintroduce this exact bug and look like a validation failure."""

# record.py lands that action on that opportunity, it resolves the ask under the SAME lock hold,
# before release. An ask without `resolves_when` is deliberately untouched — guessing which ask
# an action answers is how a still-needed question gets silently closed, which is worse than the
