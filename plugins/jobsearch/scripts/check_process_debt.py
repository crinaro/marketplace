Enforce the process-debt invariant: **ZERO open process items after a weekly run.**

THE RULE (the candidate, 2026-08-02)
---------------------------
    "On the process report there should be zero items for you to resolve, because
     they should be resolved in the weekly strategy run. The issues can accumulate
     during the week from the daily runs but zero should exist after the weekly run."

So `## ⚙️ Process — 🔧 Open` in focus.md is a WEEKLY WORK QUEUE, not a museum. Daily
runs may append to it freely; the weekly run must drain it to empty. An item leaves
the queue exactly one of four ways:

  1. FIXED           — do the work, verify it by running the thing, archive the entry.
  2. ALREADY FIXED   — verify against the machine, then archive. (On 2026-08-02, 10 of
                       23 items were closed lessons nobody had cleared.)
  3. NOT MINE        — it needs the candidate's decision/credential/fact → move it to
                       `## ⚙️ Process — ⚡ Needs the candidate`, which is a real ask list.
  4. WON'T FIX       — say why, in one line, and archive it. A declined item is closed.

Before archiving anything, check the DURABLE HOME. An item usually carries a lesson;
if that lesson is not already a rule in `CLAUDE.md` or in a `.claude/agents/*.md`
definition, archiving it DELETES the knowledge. On 2026-08-02 three rules had no
durable home (the LinkedIn-fetch invents-<the commute anchor> rule, the grep-the-published-output
rule, the connection-degree reply check) and were promoted before their items were
archived.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A RULE
---------------------------
Because the same list grew to 23 items while a rule saying "keep it short" sat at the
top of the file. This repo's own recurring lesson is that a rule in prose is re-read
and re-interpreted every run, while a check fails loudly and for free.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_process_debt.py            # advisory (daily) — always exit 0
    python3 scripts/check_process_debt.py --weekly   # ENFORCING — exit 1 if not drained

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.
