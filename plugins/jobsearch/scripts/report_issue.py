"""Report an engine defect from an INSTALLED plugin — GitHub #58, #59, #61.

The engine documented exactly one route for reporting its own defects:

    python3 <marketplace-dev>/scripts/intake.py --add …

⚠️ THAT PATH SHIPS NOWHERE. It exists only in the private maintainer repository. On a
machine that also has a maintainer's checkout it silently resolved to *that* tree — which is
how it was found — and on every other machine it resolves to nothing. Five shipped files
instructed it.

This is the shipped replacement, and the differences are the point:

  * ⭐ IT RESOLVES INSIDE THE INSTALL. The target comes from this plugin's own
    `plugin.json.repository`, read from the same directory this file lives in. Nothing
    searches the filesystem for a similarly-named script, which is the rule #59 asks for:
    with six engine versions coexisting in the cache, every script name exists at six paths
    at once and a search can match the wrong one.

  * ⭐ IT REPORTS TO THE PUBLIC MARKETPLACE, because that is the only tracker a user can
    see. `intake.py` targets the PRIVATE dev repo and refuses to file publicly; the two
    tools point in opposite directions on purpose, and neither should be reachable from the
    other's audience.

  * ⭐ IT CARRIES VERSION PROVENANCE (#61). Engine version and profile schema version go in
    as structured fields. A report that cannot say which version produced the behaviour
    cannot be triaged, confirmed fixed, or told apart from one about code nobody maintains.

⚠️ IT REFUSES A REPORT CARRYING PERSONAL DATA. A public issue is permanent, and the shapes
below are the ones that actually arrive: a comp figure, a phone number, an address, a
person's name. Refusal is the whole point — the reporter can rephrase; a filed issue cannot
be unfiled.

Usage:
    ~/.claude/jobsearch/run report_issue.py --title "…" --symptom "…" [--evidence "…"]
    ~/.claude/jobsearch/run report_issue.py --title "…" --symptom "…" --file
        (without --file it prints the report for you to read first)

Python 3.9+. Standard library only. Filing needs the `gh` CLI; without it the report is
printed with the tracker URL so it can be pasted in by hand.
