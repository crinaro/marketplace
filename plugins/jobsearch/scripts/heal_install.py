"""Startup self-heal for the install manifest (marketplace issue #11, adr-014).

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS
------------------
Neither `claude plugin install` nor `claude plugin update` rewrites the per-plugin manifest under
`~/.claude/plugins/.install-manifests/` — verified twice on consecutive releases on 2026-08-11,
including a full uninstall-then-reinstall cycle that left the manifest byte-identical (same mtime,
same `createdAt`, same file count). `installed_plugins.json` moves correctly — `installPath` and
`gitCommitSha` both update — while the manifest keeps describing the PREVIOUS version. The
release gate `the install verification` then reports drift on every release, and until this script the
repair was a hand edit — the exact "and then someone runs a command" failure the rulebook forbids.

So the engine heals it itself, at session start, from the same `SessionStart` hook that already
migrates profile data (`migrate.py --hook`): one mechanism keeps both the user's DATA and their
INSTALL current with the running version.

## ⭐⭐ THE SCOPE RULE: HEAL ONLY THE MISMATCH THAT IS EXPLAINED

The manifest exists to detect tampering and corruption. Regenerating whenever hashes mismatch
would turn `the install verification` into a script that erases its own failure. The one mismatch this
script repairs is the installer defect, stated as a testable condition:

    EXPLAINED (healed)      the manifest's recorded hash of `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` differs
                            from the file on disk — the version-carrying file itself moved —
                            AND `installed_plugins.json` records the same version the disk does
                            (i.e. the installer RAN and updated everything except the manifest).

    UNEXPLAINED (loud,      same version on both sides but hashes differ; or the version file
    never written)          was never recorded; or `installed_plugins.json` disagrees with the
                            disk. That is corruption or tampering, not the installer defect,
                            and it must stay visible until a human decides.

    MISSING MANIFEST        reported, never fabricated. First install demonstrably writes one,
    (loud, never written)   so absence is anomalous — inventing a baseline would stamp
                            install-time provenance on files this script cannot vouch for.

⚠️ The write target is a file OWNED BY CLAUDE CODE. Schema observed 2026-08-11:
`{pluginId, createdAt, files}`. A heal preserves every field it does not understand, replaces
only `files`, appends a `heals` audit record, and leaves the replaced content beside the manifest
as `<name>.json.bak-heal` — preserve, then transform. A future Claude Code build that rewrites
manifests itself simply finds nothing to heal.

⚠️ FAILS OPEN, ALWAYS — same rule as `migrate.py`: housekeeping must never block a session.
And silent when healthy: the hook output is for things a person should see.

The guard question (adr-010) is resolved deliberately in adr-014, not routed around: this script
is the ONE sanctioned writer of a manifest, and `guard_engine_writes.py` now denies Write/Edit
tool calls into `.install-manifests/` unconditionally, so a session cannot hand-"repair" the
tamper record the way it was hand-repaired twice on 2026-08-11.

Usage:
    python3 heal_install.py            # heal if explained; loud if not; silent if healthy
    python3 heal_install.py --check    # report only; writes nothing
    python3 heal_install.py --root P   # diagnose an explicit installed copy (test seam, and
                                       # lets release-manager point it at a cache path)

Exit codes: 0 healthy/healed/not-installed · 1 unexplained/no-manifest (so it can serve as a
check) — but `migrate.py` calls `heal()` in-process and keeps its own always-0 contract.
