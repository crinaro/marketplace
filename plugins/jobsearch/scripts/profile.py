"""
Load `profile.json` and make its screening rules EXECUTABLE.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Created 2026-08-02, when the candidate asked to segment the process from the user data.

The tiered comp floor lived only as ~400 words of prose in `CLAUDE.md`. Prose gets
re-interpreted by a fresh model every run, and this particular prose has already
produced a real, costly error: on **2026-07-22 a re-scoring pass failed <an employer> against
the relocation bar** — but <an employer> is **25 minutes from the candidate's house**.
The pass had read `location.type == "onsite"` as "must relocate."

`onsite` in the data does NOT mean "move." It means the seat is in an office. Whether
that costs the candidate anything depends entirely on WHERE the office is, and there is a whole
separate, LOWER local-onsite tier for offices inside their commute radius. Getting this backwards flips a passing role into a failing one.

    screen_comp() encodes that distinction so it cannot drift again.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/profile.py                      # print the loaded profile summary
    python3 scripts/profile.py --screen <opp_id>    # screen one opportunity
    python3 scripts/profile.py --screen-all         # screen the whole live pipeline

    from profile import load, screen_comp, effective_setting

# `validate_data.py` began importing this module when `owner_token()` replaced a hardcoded name
# (issue #35), so a resolver that only ever finds a REAL profile took the data gate down in CI:
# `FileNotFoundError: .../user.json`, on a runner that deliberately has no profile.
#
# ⚠️ The obvious repair — catch the error and exit 0 when there is no profile — is the exact
# defect three gates were fixed for in this same branch: a check that reports success having
# read nothing. `profile_or_fixture()` is the answer the rest of the engine already uses. It
# resolves the real profile where one exists and the SYNTHESIZED fixture otherwise, so CI runs
# the real code against real-shaped data instead of skipping it.
