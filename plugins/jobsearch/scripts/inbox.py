"""
The COORDINATOR's view of the watcher queue — what the background sweeps found.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02, wanted the daily check to run every ~2 hours without colliding with the
session the candidate is actually working in. The split that makes that safe:

    WATCHER (scripts/watch.py, every 2h)   read-only; appends findings here. Never writes state.
    COORDINATOR (the interactive session)  the ONLY writer. Drains this queue and acts.

This is the coordinator half. It never touches the mailbox — it reads the queue the watcher
already built, so draining it is instant and costs nothing.

**Why a queue rather than a message:** `send_message` is explicitly unavailable in
scheduled-task runs and cannot deliver to them, so a worker literally cannot message a session.
A file is also better: it survives session death, can be drained hours later, and is keyed so
the same finding is never queued twice.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/inbox.py                 # pending findings, urgent first
    python3 scripts/inbox.py --all           # include already-handled
    python3 scripts/inbox.py --ack <id>      # mark one handled
    python3 scripts/inbox.py --ack-kind alert  # mark a whole class handled
    python3 scripts/inbox.py --prune 30      # drop handled findings older than N days

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.

# ⭐⭐ WHY `run-summary` EXISTS — added 2026-08-03, and it closes a hole I opened that morning.
#
# The candidate: *"Did the 9am run send an update to the coordinator session? I didn't see that. There is a
# bunch of information in the 9am session I didn't see in the coordinator view."* Both channels
# were silent, for two different reasons:
#
#   PUSH  `notifyOnCompletion` had never been claimed — no subscriber, so no notification.
#   PULL  this queue had **zero** records from that run.
#
# The PULL half is the one I broke. Before the lock redesign, a run that collided with the candidate's
# session DOWNGRADED to `watch.py`, which queued what it found, and the coordinator drained it.
# Making runs able to write concurrently removed the downgrade — correct for state, but the
# downgrade path was **also the only thing feeding this queue**. So a full run wrote everything
# into data/*.jsonl and told the coordinator nothing.
#
# Nothing was lost; it was invisible, which for a role that needs a decision is nearly as bad.
# The 09:07 run booked a Larkbridge Technology call for Wed 08/05 9:00 AM and sourced three roles, and none of
# it surfaced in their view.
#
# So a FULL run now posts a summary here as its last act. **This is a notification, never a
# substitute for state** — the writes still happen in the run.

    this file from a downgraded background run, which by design runs *while the coordinator
    holds the lock* — so the two writers are concurrent on purpose. This function used to
    rewrite the whole file on `--ack`, and a rewrite that began before an append landed would
    silently CLOBBER it. The finding would vanish with no trace.

    So state is now a LOG, not a document: `--ack` appends an ack record, and current status is
    derived by replaying the file. Appends of this size are atomic; a rewrite never is.
