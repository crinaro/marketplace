"""Notice mid-session that the engine moved underneath this session — GitHub #42.

SessionStart fires exactly once. A session that spans a version bump therefore keeps its
loaded skills, agents and hooks from the OLD version while every script it shells out to
resolves the NEW one through `~/.claude/jobsearch/run`, which walks the install cache for
the newest complete version at call time (TEMPLATE_GENERATION 3 — the `engine_root` file
is informational only).
The migration hook cannot re-fire, so the profile stays on the old shape for the rest of
that session — and both halves look healthy on their own.

⭐ THIS IS A GUARD, NOT THE MIGRATION. It compares two strings and says something. It does
not apply anything: mutating a user's data mid-turn, while a live session holds assumptions
about that data in context, is its own hazard, and a scheduled run may be holding the write
lock. Per #42 the failure being fixed is SILENCE, not the absence of an automatic fix.

⚠️ IT RUNS ON EVERY PROMPT, so it must stay cheap and it must never block. Two small file
reads, a string compare, and exit 0 on every path including every error.

Also surfaces the condition behind #41: a stamp sitting behind the installed engine with
nothing anywhere saying so.

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.
