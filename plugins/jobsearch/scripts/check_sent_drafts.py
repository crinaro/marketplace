"""Flag drafts/letters that have ALREADY BEEN SENT OR USED but are still shown as pending.

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-03). The candidate, looking at the dashboard: *"on your move, i'm still seeing
the drafts for <an employer> (what's wrong)"*. The candidate was right. They had sent the email and
applied with the cover letter attached; both facts were correctly written into `data/*.jsonl`, and
**both entries were still sitting in `drafts.md` / `cover_letters.md` as "awaiting approval."**

The failure is structural, not careless. Recording a send touches the JSON; retiring the markdown
entry is a SECOND, SEPARATE step, and anything that depends on remembering a second step
eventually does not happen. It is the same shape as the lock bug fixed earlier the same day
(`runlock.py --run`), and the same shape as the stale-dashboard bug before that.

**What it costs when it slips:** the candidate's Your Move panel is their queue. An item that is actually
DONE sitting in it is worse than noise — they either re-do the work, or they start distrusting the
panel, and a queue they distrust stops being a queue.

Heuristic and deliberately conservative: it matches a pending entry's heading against contact
names and company names that already carry a `sent` outreach row or a `submitted`/`rejected`
application. It reports SUSPECTS, not verdicts, and **always exits 0** — this is run-start hygiene
and must never wedge an unattended run. `validate_data.py` remains the only hard gate.

⚠️ A legitimately half-sent entry is normal: a connection request can be out while the follow-up
message waits on acceptance. Say so IN THE HEADING (e.g. "PART A SENT · part B pending") and this
check will still flag it — read the flag, confirm the pending half is real, and move on.
