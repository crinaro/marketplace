"""
The WATCHER — a frequent, strictly read-only sweep that reports findings to a queue.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02:

    "How do we support the daily check running more often. The issue, I'm interacting in a
     session and it conflicts with another session running. Is there a way to have a global
     (coordinator concept) that's the interactive session and what happens in the daily today
     can run behind the scenes and executes more often and sends a message back to the
     coordinator (long running session)... I could run what's happening in the daily more often
     (say every 2 hours between 7am and 4pm)."

**The conflict is about WRITES, not reads.** Two sessions reading the mailbox is harmless; two
sessions rewriting `data/*.jsonl`, `log.md` and git is what clobbers. So the split is:

    WATCHER (this script, every 2h)   read-only. Finds things. Appends to data/inbox.jsonl.
                                      NEVER writes state, NEVER touches git, NEVER edits the stores.
    COORDINATOR (the interactive      the ONLY writer. Drains the queue, decides, updates the
    session, or a daily run)          JSON, commits.

**A queue file beats a message**, which matters because `send_message` is explicitly unavailable
in scheduled-task runs and cannot deliver to them either. A file also survives session death, can
be drained hours later, and is idempotent — findings are keyed, so running every two hours does
not produce ten copies of the same alert.

By construction this script cannot conflict with anything: the only file it opens for writing is
`data/inbox.jsonl`, and only in append mode.

WHAT IT WATCHES
---------------
  * new alert-digest roles not already in the pipeline
  * meeting artifacts whose date is in no data/commitments.jsonl row
  * inbound mail from a tracked contact after we last wrote to them (an unrecorded reply)
  * ATS receipts for applications still marked `submitted`

Usage:
    python3 scripts/watch.py                  # sweep and queue findings
    python3 scripts/watch.py --dry-run        # show what it would queue, write nothing
    python3 scripts/watch.py --since 4        # look back N hours (default 3)

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.
