"""
A compact one-line-per-role index of the pipeline — the cheap answer to
"is this role already tracked?"

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`inbox-scan` runs on haiku with a ~650-word brief, and its job is to decide whether a role
in an alert is new. To do that it was being pointed at `data/opportunities.jsonl` — 161 full
records with research logs, outreach arrays and application history — which is the single
largest unnecessary read in the daily flow. The question is "have we seen this?", and that
is answerable from one line per record.

Same principle as `alert_sweep.py`: deterministic work belongs in a query, not in a model
summary (CLAUDE.md token discipline).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/pipeline_index.py                # active roles (the default view)
    python3 scripts/pipeline_index.py --all          # every record, including passed
    python3 scripts/pipeline_index.py --excluded     # ONLY the exclusion list
    python3 scripts/pipeline_index.py --company acme # filter by company id substring
    python3 scripts/pipeline_index.py --contacts     # include contact names

THE EXCLUSION LIST is `verdict: pass` OR `status: passed`. That definition lives here and in
`docs/schema.md`; agents should call this script rather than re-deriving it, because an agent
that invents its own definition of "already excluded" will re-surface roles the candidate has declined.

⭐ `status: expired` (issue #6) is terminal but is NOT on the exclusion list. Excluded means
the candidate DECLINED — never resurface. Expired means the posting vanished before any decision
was made, so a NEW sighting of an expired role is a repost and must surface as a fresh signal,
not be auto-dropped as "already ruled out". Expired rows are hidden from the default (active)
view — they are not live work — and counted separately in the footer.

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.
