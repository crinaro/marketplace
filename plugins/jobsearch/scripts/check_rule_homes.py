Guarantee that archiving an incident never DELETES the rule it produced.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`CLAUDE.md` is loaded into every run and inherited by every subagent as project memory, and
on 2026-08-02 it measured **9,430 words, 56% of it incident narrative**. That is not merely
bloat — it is the mechanism behind a recurring failure: stale narrative gets read back as
current fact. Three separate instances landed in a single day (a log entry claiming a data
write that never happened; a focus.md item proposing an already-shipped fix; `funnel_report.py`
printing a hardcoded claim the weekly review then quoted as evidence).

The fix is to move the stories to `docs/incident_archive.md` and keep the RULES. The danger is
that ~35 of those bullets have an operating rule embedded *inside* the story, so archiving
wholesale silently deletes it.

This script makes that impossible to do by accident:

  1. **Every archive entry must carry a `→` back-pointer, and it must RESOLVE** — to text in
     `CLAUDE.md` / an agent definition / a task prompt, or to a dotted `config.json` key.
     *This is the guarantee.* An entry whose rule has no home fails the check.
  2. Every `docs/incident_archive.md#anchor` referenced from CLAUDE.md resolves to a real
     heading (catches a broken pointer in the other direction).
  3. **A CLAUDE.md word-budget RATCHET.** Same pattern as `MAX_UNDATED` in the test suite:
     the number only ever goes down. Without it the file simply re-accretes, which is the
     actual complaint.

The precedent being followed is already in the repo: `focus.md` says *"Before archiving an
item, check its lesson has a durable home in CLAUDE.md or a `.claude/agents/*.md` definition —
otherwise archiving deletes the knowledge,"* and `check_process_debt.py` prints it every run.
This is that rule, mechanized, for CLAUDE.md instead of focus.md.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_rule_homes.py            # verify; exit 1 on a problem
    python3 scripts/check_rule_homes.py --report   # report only, always exit 0

    set via subprocess.

    Three ways to resolve, tried in order:
      1. `target` IS a home's label (e.g. "CLAUDE.md", "docs/architecture.md") — and if the
         pointer text quotes rule text in double quotes, that quoted text must actually
         appear in the home.
      2. `target` is a `config.json.a.b` dotted key that exists.
      3. `target` is a bare filename mentioned in some OTHER home's text.

    ⭐ dev 2026-08-23 — plugin-architect audit of its own m_0_31_0_mail_client_rename work:
    (3) used to search EVERY home, including `scripts/test_checks.py`, whose own
    TestMigrateMailClientRename fixtures assert the migrated string "scripts/mail_client.py"
    as literal TEST DATA — and that alone satisfied a real archive back-pointer naming the
    same file, with no genuine home (CLAUDE.md / an agent / a skill / a doc) ever saying
    anything about where the file lives. Confirmed against the owner's actual, unmigrated
    profile: its "scripts/gmail_mcp_server.py" back-pointer resolved, before this fix, only
    through this identical accidental path.

    test_checks.py counts as a home for an ASSERTION that ENFORCES a rule (see
    audit_load_bearing's `_only_in_docstring`, which already treats a test docstring
    describing a rule as not a home). A string appearing anywhere in its source — including
    inside another test's fixture data — is not an assertion and is not prose that can
    attest what a bare filename means, so (3) excludes it. A bare-filename pointer needs a
    genuine NARRATIVE home.
