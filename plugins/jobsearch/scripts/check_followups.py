"""Flag outreach threads that have gone silent, and pursuits with no next action.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-20)
----------------------------
The weekly strategy review named this gap as proposal #4 and it had fired **zero
times**: a follow-up rule written on 2026-07-14 was never enforced by anything,
while five threads sat silent for 12-13 days. Messages get sent, replies never
come, and nothing in the system notices -- because noticing was left to a human
remembering to scan a 97-row table.

`check_stale_claims.py` catches decayed *claims*. This catches decayed *threads*:

  1. SILENT OUTREACH -- a message/connection request was sent, the status still
     says awaiting/pending/no-reply, and N+ days have passed.
  2. ACTIVE PURSUIT, NO NEXT ACTION -- a live pursuit record whose text contains no
     recognizable next step. "Pursue" without a next action is how the 2026-07-15
     "next action identified != next action executed" gap happened.

Run it at the START of every daily and weekly run, alongside check_stale_claims.py.

    python3 scripts/check_followups.py [--days N] [--quiet]

Exit code is 0 even when it finds things -- it's an advisory report, not a gate,
so it can't wedge an unattended run.

Targets system Python 3.8 (/usr/bin/python3): no third-party packages, no
zoneinfo, no walrus, no X | Y annotations.
