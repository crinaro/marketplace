"""Find status claims in the trackers that have gone stale, and system-state
claims that must be re-verified against the machine before anyone repeats them.

Why this exists (2026-07-19): the weekly strategy review reported "apply the
wake_chrome fix - still unapplied after 4 days" as its #2 proposal. It was
wrong. The fix had landed on 2026-07-17 as a side effect of the repo move out
of ~/Documents, and the LaunchAgent had been firing cleanly at 06:58/13:58 ever
since. The stale sentence in focus.md ("not yet applied - awaiting the candidate's
go-ahead") was written 7/15, never revisited, and got read back as current fact.

Two distinct failure modes, both handled here:

  1. AGING CLAIMS - "awaiting the candidate", "pending approval", "sitting since 7/10".
     These decay silently. Nothing marks them stale; they just get re-read.

  2. SYSTEM-STATE CLAIMS - "the fix is not yet applied", "the script is broken",
     "the LaunchAgent never fires". These are assertions about the machine, and
     the machine is the source of truth, NOT the tracker. A tracker can only
     ever tell you what was true when someone typed it.

Type 2 is the dangerous one: it reads as researched fact, and it is checkable in
seconds. This script cannot verify them for you - it flags them so a human or
agent goes and looks.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_stale_claims.py              # default: 5-day threshold
    python3 scripts/check_stale_claims.py --days 3
    python3 scripts/check_stale_claims.py --quiet      # only exit code, for hooks

Exit codes: 0 = nothing flagged, 1 = stale claims found (advisory, not a failure).

Targets system Python 3.8, no third-party packages, so it runs unattended.

# ⭐ Issue #34, part 3. `REPO` used to be derived from `__file__` — the ENGINE's own location.
# `focus.md`/`network.md`/`drafts.md` are the CANDIDATE's own trackers and live in the PROFILE,
# which is a different tree as a plugin. So this scanned the engine, found none of them, and
# `scan()`'s `except IOError: return aging, system` swallowed that silently — every run printed
# "Nothing flagged. Trackers look current." having read zero lines. Same root-resolution bug as
# check_pointers.py, same fix: resolve against the profile (falling back to the fixture so the
# gate is RUNNABLE in CI, matching every other gate's convention).

# NOTE (2026-07-21): `opportunities.md` is deliberately NOT scanned. It was
# retired 2026-07-20, is frozen as a historical snapshot, and is not to be
# edited -- so every line it flagged was unfixable by construction and would
# have been re-reported every run forever. Role-level decay is now caught by
# check_followups.py against data/opportunities.jsonl, which IS live.
# `handoff.md` added with dev #93: it is the surviving hand-written narrative (the session
# handoff letter) and exactly the place a decayed "awaiting X" claim now lives.
#
# ⚠️ `focus.md` was DROPPED from this list 2026-08-25 (gate-keeper triage, no tracked issue —
# found while diagnosing a pre-existing `test_repo_is_the_profile_not_the_engine` failure). It
# used to be kept post-migration as a frozen stub — "costs nothing to scan and can never flag" — on
# the assumption the stub itself would persist. It does not: a real profile's own root-cleanup
# pass (verified against the installed plugin, which confirmed nothing reads or writes the
# file — exactly what ADR-017 says) archived the stub out of the profile root entirely. `scan()`
# already treats a missing FILES entry as advisory ("not found, so not scanned"), so keeping
# `focus.md` here bought nothing once the stub itself became optional, and it broke
# TestStaleClaimsScansTheProfileNotTheEngine's real-profile assertion for a file the engine
# genuinely no longer needs present.
