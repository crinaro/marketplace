"""
The JD-fit register: how the candidate matches each role, and the OPEN GAPS worth asking about.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Added 2026-08-02, per the candidate:

    "How is the candidate match to the JD? How would you present the candidate is a fit and
     what are items that don't align? If you do this you get alignment on the marketing for
     alignment and also fill in gaps. I personally don't have everything on my resume and it
     helps build context for what the candidate has done so the knowledge base for the
     candidate builds to improve communication for future job opportunities, improving their
     resume or any other communication."

Two outputs, and the second is the durable one:

1. **Marketing alignment** — the matched requirements and their `pitch_line`s, so outreach and
   the cover letter are built from a stated fit case instead of re-inventing positioning per
   draft.
2. **Gap harvesting** — every requirement nothing on file corroborates becomes a targeted
   question. Their answer is filed into a store that already exists (`projects.md`,
   the claim union's "Additional Detail" addenda (presence/claims.md; store label `resume.md`
   for continuity with existing fit blocks), or `kb_<company>.md`), so the NEXT role starts
   from a fuller picture. Their resume is deliberately incomplete; this is how the missing
   context gets captured while a live role makes it concrete.

**The counts here are COMPUTED every run, never stored.** Storing a summary is exactly how
`funnel_report.py` came to print a hardcoded "stage never advances past contacted" claim that
was true when written and false when read.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/fit_report.py                 # register + open gaps
    python3 scripts/fit_report.py --gaps          # ONLY the open questions (for Your Move)
    python3 scripts/fit_report.py --role <opp_id> # one role's full fit case
    python3 scripts/fit_report.py --pitch <opp_id># just the pitch lines, for drafting

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.
