"""Does a hand-authored action item claim something the operating store already disproves?

GitHub #43. The decision surface carries two kinds of item. Derived ones — role decisions
from `opportunities.jsonl`, relationship follow-ups from `channels.jsonl` — cannot go stale,
because they are filters over records and vanish when the record changes. The cross-cutting
asks (`data/asks.jsonl` since dev #93; focus.md prose before that) have hand-authored TEXT
that can assert a state the store already contradicts, and nothing compared the two: the
schema validator checks structure, the section checker checks phrasing and duplication, and
the mailbox reconciliation touches the communications store but never the ask text. So a
resolved ask sat listed as pending until a human happened to notice.

⭐ THIS IS THE BACKSTOP, NOT THE PRIMARY CONTROL. #44 removes the drift class for items that
are derivable at all; this catches what is left, which should be only genuinely unmodelled
asks. A shrinking output here is the design working.

⚠️ ADVISORY, AND DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE — EXIT 0 ALWAYS. Matching prose to records is
inexact, and a check that cries wolf is a check somebody switches off. It flags only when a
named entity in the item is matched to a dated record that is NEWER than the item's own
deadline; it never edits, never blocks, and says plainly that a flag is a question.

⭐ dev #133 / public #22 — a SECOND, EXACT comparison alongside the fuzzy name match above.
`known_entities()` only ever modelled CONTACT touches (channels, messages, sent outreach);
an ask about a DECISION on the opportunity itself — "approve applying?" — had nothing to
compare against even after the application was submitted and recorded in that opportunity's
own `applications[]`, because nobody's name appears in that kind of ask text. The ask row
already carries `opp_id`, an exact foreign key, so `opp_action_evidence()` compares an ask
to ITS OWN linked opportunity's recorded applications/outreach directly — no name-matching,
no fuzziness, and it is the same evidence funnel_report.py already trusts.
