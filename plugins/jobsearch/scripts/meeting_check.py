"""
Deterministic meeting-artifact sweep, cross-checked against data/commitments.jsonl.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every meeting miss in this repo's history came from the same shape of failure: a
calendar artifact arrived in the mailbox, a model-driven scan didn't surface it,
and the recorded schedule stayed stale until the candidate noticed. It happened with the
<an employer> call, the <a recruiter>/<a firm> call, and — worst — the **<an employer> round-2
interview booked for the NEXT MORNING**, which landed *inside* the 2PM scan's own
window and was reported as "no new recruiter/human contact."

The 2026-07-21 fix was a rule ("scan for meeting artifacts FIRST"), and rules of
that kind have already failed twice here: a numbered priority list in a brief reads
as permission to ignore everything else, and the agent obeys the list. This script
is the deterministic version of that rule — the same promotion `alert_sweep.py`
made for job alerts, applied to calendar artifacts:

    a daily, predictable artifact belongs in a QUERY, not a model summary.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
1. Sweeps EVERY configured mailbox for calendar/meeting artifacts (invitations, acceptances,
   updates, cancellations, .ics attachments, and the booking-tool wording).
2. Extracts every date-looking token from each subject.
3. Diffs those against the dates already recorded in data/commitments.jsonl
   (the store behind the This Week tab — dev #93).
4. Prints anything found in the mail but ABSENT from This Week as a loud
   ⚠️ UNRECONCILED block.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
It does NOT decide the meeting time. Subject lines lie — CLAUDE.md's hard rule is
that a thread's subject can be weeks stale while its newest message schedules
something tomorrow ("Re: Appointment booked: ... @ Wed Jul 15" carried the 7/22
booking). So this reports ARTIFACTS TO GO READ, and the authoritative time still
comes from `gmail_get_attachment` + `parse_ics.py`. A clean run here means
"nothing unreconciled," never "the schedule is correct."

Same coverage guarantee as the Gmail server it reuses: every configured account by default,
and an unreachable account is a LOUD banner and a non-zero exit, never a silent zero.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/meeting_check.py               # last 7 days (the run default)
    python3 scripts/meeting_check.py --days 14
    python3 scripts/meeting_check.py --today 2026-08-02

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.

# ⭐⭐ THE DATE-COLLISION BLIND SPOT — fixed 2026-08-03.
#
# Reconciliation used to be `future & known`: a set of dates from the mail against a set of dates
# from This Week. **So the SECOND meeting on an already-listed date was invisible.** On 2026-08-03
# Aldric Fenwick's invite booked Larkbridge Technology (synthesized names) for Wed 08/05 9:00 AM
# *during* the run. 08/05 was already in This Week for the Halloway Partners intro, so
# `future & known` was non-empty and this script
# said "reconciled". It was caught only because the run pulled the .ics anyway per the hard rule.
#
# **A date is not an identity.** Two calls can land on one morning — these two did, back-to-back
# at 8:00 and 9:00. So a match now needs the DATE *and* a shared counterparty token, and a date
# that matches with no shared token is reported as a COLLISION, which is louder than "new",
# because it is the case a human is most likely to wave through.
