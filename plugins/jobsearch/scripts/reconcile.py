Reconcile tracked opportunity state against the SOURCE CHANNELS — the mailbox and LinkedIn.

⚠️ THIS IS A RECONCILIATION MODE, NOT THE OPERATING PATH.
---------------------------------------------------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02: *"We have the luxury we can reconcile against the sources (mail and LinkedIn)
but that should only be used for a reconciliation mode. The process should be using the json data
and making incremental updates during the daily runs."*

**`data/*.jsonl` is the system of RECORD. The mailbox is the system of TRUTH**, consulted
periodically to catch drift. The daily run reads and writes the JSON as things happen; it does not
re-derive state from the mailbox. This script runs **weekly**, as an audit.

**Anything it finds is a PROCESS FAILURE, not a routine result.** An unrecorded reply means the
daily run that should have written it missed something — log that, don't just apply the fix. A
clean reconcile means the incremental updates are working.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02:

    "Why can't the process have the ability to review opportunities, if it did, it should have
     the ability to resolve the issue. It should be the same to evaluate the current state of an
     opportunity. Look at email, look at messages in LinkedIn. Those give the system the ability
     to evaluate. I know we have a step to check the ATS but that's really only going to let us
     know if the recruiter looked at the application. Yes, that's valuable but the other channels
     are much more important and the process should be able to reconcile because the same data is
     available in mail and LinkedIn."

The candidate was correcting a claim I had made: that 22 outreach rows with `medium: unknown` were
unrecoverable because "no contemporaneous record exists." **That was wrong.** The record exists —
the actual messages are still sitting in the mailbox. I had only looked at what the repo had
written down about itself, not at the source.

That is the general failure this script fixes. Tracked state is a *transcription* of what happened
in email and LinkedIn. A transcription can be incomplete (a row never written), stale (a reply
that arrived after we last looked), or lossy (`medium: unknown`). **The source can be re-read at
any time.** The ATS portal check tells you only whether a recruiter opened an application; the
conversation itself is where the real signal is.

**⭐ LinkedIn is reconcilable from the mailbox too**, which is the non-obvious part: LinkedIn emails
a notification for messages received ("X just messaged you"), invitation acceptances ("X accepted
your invitation"), and InMail. So a deterministic Gmail sweep recovers a large share of LinkedIn
state without a browser session at all.

WHAT IT REPORTS
---------------
  * **MEDIUM EVIDENCE** — a row says `medium: unknown`, but the mailbox shows a direct email
    exchange, or a LinkedIn notification, with that person.
  * **UNRECORDED REPLY** — the row says `awaiting`/`sent`, but a message FROM that contact arrived
    after we wrote to them. This is the one that costs real opportunities.
  * **UNRECORDED ACCEPTANCE** — LinkedIn says an invitation was accepted; the row does not.
  * **NO TRACE** — nothing found. Reported explicitly rather than silently skipped, because a
    zero is only meaningful when you can see it was looked for.

It NEVER writes by default. `--apply` fills in `medium` **only** where the evidence is
unambiguous, and never touches `outcome` — a reply changes what the candidate should DO, so it is surfaced
for a human decision rather than silently absorbed.

Usage (weekly audit; NOT part of the daily run):
    python3 scripts/reconcile.py                    # report on live pursuits
    python3 scripts/reconcile.py --all              # every opportunity with outreach
    python3 scripts/reconcile.py --unknown-medium   # only rows needing a medium
    python3 scripts/reconcile.py --apply            # write the unambiguous medium fixes
    python3 scripts/reconcile.py --role <opp_id>

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.

    touches to one recipient WITHIN a single pursuit — the case it was written for. But a
    recipient contacted about MORE THAN ONE opportunity — an agency recruiter presenting the
    candidate to several companies is the ordinary case, not an edge case — was split across

    The join key is the PERSON, full stop. Every outreach row addressed to them, from every
