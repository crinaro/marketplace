"""Where is the USER'S profile? (Not: where is the engine?)

⭐ THE DISTINCTION THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE (2026-08-05)
------------------------------------------------------------
Every script used to derive its root as `dirname(dirname(abspath(__file__)))` — the directory
above `scripts/`. That is correct only when the engine and the data live in the same tree, which
was true exactly once: the original single-user installation.

**As a PLUGIN they are never the same tree.** The engine installs under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
somewhere in Claude's plugin directory; the user's resume, config and pipeline live in whatever
directory they run from. Deriving the data root from `__file__` points every script at the
PLUGIN, which contains no data.

That failure is not loud. On 2026-08-05 a symlinked install did exactly this and
`generate_dashboard.py` regenerated the dashboard with ZERO opportunities and overwrote the real
one — exit 0, valid HTML, no data. **A wrong root produces empty results, not errors.**

Resolution order:
  1. `CLAUDESEARCH_ROOT`  — explicit; also what lets an AGENCY point the engine at one candidate's
     profile out of many, and what the test suite uses for isolation.
  2. the current working directory, walking UP to find a profile marker.
  3. ⭐ the REMEMBERED profile (`~/.claude/jobsearch/profile_root`).

⭐⭐ WHY (3) EXISTS — AN MCP SERVER HAS NEITHER OF THE FIRST TWO (2026-08-05).
A long-lived MCP server is spawned by the Claude runtime, not from a shell: it inherits no
`CLAUDESEARCH_ROOT` and no guarantee about its working directory. `mail_client.py` therefore
resolved a non-profile directory, found no `user.json`, and served ZERO mailboxes for the life of
the process — and a mailbox-blind search returns the same empty result as a genuinely empty
mailbox. It reported "no new mail" while the deterministic per-call sweeps, which DO start from a
shell in the profile, reached both accounts fine.

The pointer is maintained automatically: any resolution that finds a genuine profile records it.
So a single normal run from the profile directory repairs it for every process that cannot see one.

⚠️ **dev #87 — A LOUD DOWNSTREAM MESSAGE IS THE LAST LINE OF DEFENCE, NOT THE DESIGN.**
`profile_root()`'s own fallback — "return the CWD rather than guessing" a few lines below — means
it CAN legitimately land on the engine's own root: a maintenance session with no
`CLAUDESEARCH_ROOT`, no profile anywhere above the CWD, and nothing remembered has nothing better
to offer than CWD, and CWD is sometimes this very engine checkout. That happened for real (a
read-only `check_engine_purity.py` run) and was harmless only because that particular caller
handles a missing `user.json` by printing a loud `NOT CHECKED` and exiting 0 — the SAME shape as
#81, where a write-capable caller trusted the identical class of resolution (the checked-in test
fixture, not the engine root, but the same "wrong-but-plausible directory" mistake) and it was
caught only because the write itself was noticed.

**The general rule: this module resolves; it does not decide whether the resolution is safe to
act on.** Every caller decides that for itself, and a caller that only reads can survive a wrong
answer by reporting it loudly (`check_engine_purity.py`'s pattern); a caller that WRITES cannot —
it must refuse outright, using a predicate like `is_engine_root()` or `is_tracked_fixture()`
below, before it ever opens a file for writing. Do not assume a downstream message makes a wrong
resolution safe just because it did, once, somewhere else in the codebase.

A "profile" is a directory containing `config.json` or `data/`. Walking up means you can run from
a subdirectory, the way git does.

# marketplace's own NAME ("careers-plugins"). That name is not this plugin's identity — the
# marketplace rename to `crinaro/marketplace` is approved — and the moment it lands, a
# literal-name test returns False for a genuinely INSTALLED copy. That matters more than it
# looks: `_remember_engine`'s ENTIRE guard against a checkout hijacking the durable pointer is
# `is_installed_engine(current) and not is_installed_engine(path)` (below), and the worktree path
# this harness uses (`<repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>`) does not match any
# `_EPHEMERAL_MARKERS` marker either (they are separator-delimited: `/tmp/`, `/Temp/`,
# `/local-agent-mode-sessions/`, `/rpm/plugin_`). Once the name check goes stale, that guard
# silently stops holding — nothing today is broken, because the pointer currently names an
# installed copy under the CURRENT name, but the day the rename lands, a stray import from a
# checkout or worktree wins the comparison and hijacks the pointer, silently, with nobody there
# to notice (the same "the failure lands hours later in an unattended run" shape as the
# per-session-copy bug `is_ephemeral_engine` exists for, above).
#
# So the test is now STRUCTURAL — `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<any one marketplace segment>/
# jobsearch/...` — never the marketplace's literal name. `jobsearch` genuinely IS fixed: it is
# this file's own identity, the same literal already hardcoded throughout this module (`POINTER`,
# `ENGINE_POINTER`, `STATE_DIRNAME`). The marketplace segment is read structurally (`rest[0]`,
# below) and never compared against a value, so a rename cannot break this file at all.
