COORDINATOR — the one command to run when the candidate opens their working session.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02: *"What is the overall process flow for the different jobs and what session
should I interact with? If we have the concept of a coordinator session, how does it get updates
from the dependent sessions so it runs its processes?"*

## The answer to "which session do I talk to"

**The COORDINATOR — the long-running session you open at the start of the week.** You never talk
to a scheduled run; they are unattended and cannot receive a message (the platform blocks
`send_message` both to and from them). This script is what that session runs first.

## The flow

    ┌─ COORDINATOR ─────────────── you, one long-running session, all week ────────────┐

## How the coordinator gets UPDATES — the honest mechanics

There are exactly two channels, and only one of them is a push:

1. **PUSH — `notifyOnCompletion`.** A scheduled task notifies **the session that subscribed to
   it**, each time it finishes. `update_scheduled_task(taskId="search-daily",
   notifyOnCompletion=True)` **replaces any prior subscriber**, so only ever one session is
   notified. That is the only real push available.

   **⚠️ ONLY A REGULAR SESSION CAN CLAIM IT — a scheduled run cannot.** Verified 2026-08-02:
   attempting it from inside a scheduled run is refused outright, *"Can't subscribe a
   scheduled-task run session to completion notifications — it ends when the run does."* So
   **The candidate must run this from THEIR interactive session**; no automation can set it up for them, and
   it must be re-claimed whenever they start a fresh coordinator session.

2. **PULL — `data/inbox.jsonl`.** Everything a background run found. This is the durable half:
   it survives a closed app, a dead session, and a missed notification, and findings are keyed so
   nothing is ever queued twice. **A notification can be lost; the queue cannot.**

**There is no message-passing between sessions here.** `send_message` cannot reach or come from a
scheduled run. So state moves through FILES — the queue, `data/*.jsonl`, and `handoff.md`, the
session-handoff letter. That is a feature: a file is inspectable, replayable, and does not depend on any
session still being alive.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/coordinator.py          # stand up the session; does NOT take the lock
    python3 scripts/coordinator.py --take   # hold it all session (rarely correct)

**⭐ IT DOES NOT TAKE THE LOCK — corrected 2026-08-03.** the candidate: *"Why can't it run concurrently
with the coordinator session? That was the main purpose."* Holding it from startup blocked every
background run for as long as the candidate had a session open; on 08-03 an idle session held it 28 minutes
and cost the 07:00 run outright. **Lock around each WRITE and release immediately:**
`runlock.py --take "coordinator write" --wait 60` ... edit ... `--release`.
