ENGINE vs DATA — does a reusable file still carry one person's data?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-03: *"I'm going through the markdowns for the process and agents and too many
still have my data. Can we clean them up and make sure there is a clear separation between the
system and the data (context)?"*

`check_profile_leakage.py` already guards ONE value type: comp figures. A full audit found **394
personal-data markers across all 18 engine files** — names, employers, target companies, cities,
mailboxes, and named individuals. The worst were not the names. They were **rules with one
person's resume baked into them**, e.g. an agent spec naming one specific employer to lead with and three
others as "niche, a stranger won't recognize them." That is a GENERIC rule (lead with the
employer a stranger recognizes) wearing one person's resume. Ship the engine to someone else and
it confidently gives wrong instructions.

## ⭐ THE TAXONOMY — and why NOT everything gets scrubbed

Blanket-stripping names would destroy the thing that makes this repo work: rules that carry the
incident that produced them. So files are classified, and only two classes must be pure.

    ENGINE   must be PORTABLE — zero personal data. A different candidate could use these
             unchanged.  agents/*.md · skills/*/SKILL.md · commands/*.md · scripts/*.py
             · docs/*.md · RULEBOOK.md   (see ENGINE_FAMILIES — the authoritative list)

    PROFILE  IS the personal data, by design.  user.json · config.json · resume.md
             · projects.md · strategy.md · network.md · data/*

    RECORD   the history OF THIS SEARCH. Inherently about this person, never meant to be
             portable, and genericizing it would delete the evidence a rule rests on.
             docs/incident_archive.md · log.md · focus.md · kb/*.md

    MANUAL   RULEBOOK.md — the rulebook (installed into the profile as its CLAUDE.md).
             Rules are engine; the values they operate on are not.
             It may NAME a pointer (`config.json.positioning`) but must not restate a value.

**The test for ENGINE, stated once:** could another candidate use this file unchanged? If a
sentence would be WRONG for them, the fact belongs in `config.json`/`user.json` and the file
should point at it.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_engine_purity.py            # exit 1 if an ENGINE file carries data
    python3 scripts/check_engine_purity.py --verbose  # show every hit with its line
    python3 scripts/check_engine_purity.py --all      # audit every class, advisory

#
# The FILES to scan are ENGINE — they live with this script, wherever the plugin is installed.
# The TERMS to scan for are PROFILE — they live in the user's own data directory. These are
# never the same directory, and a checker that reads one when it means the other does not
# raise: it scans an empty set and certifies the result.
#
# ⚠️ THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS FILE DID until 2026-08-09. Both globs resolved under
# `profile_root()`, and they were written before the plugin split moved engine files out of the
# profile entirely. Locally the pointer resolved a real profile, so the ENGINE list came out as
# ONE file — the profile's own CLAUDE.md — and the gate printed
#
#     CLEAN. Every agent spec and run prompt is portable.
#
# having scanned zero agent specs and zero run prompts. In CI, with no profile on the host, it
# read zero terms and exited 0 with a different message. Two vacuity modes, both green, for
# days. This is the marketplace's signature failure — a missing thing reading as an empty thing
# and getting reported as fact — committed by the very gate written to prevent it.

# ⭐ ADRs ARE ENGINE — corrected 2026-08-03. They were first classed RECORD ("the history of
# this search"), which the candidate challenged: *"Are you sure adrs are search decisions or
# architecture? I would have assumed architectural."* That was right, and the name says so —
# Architecture Decision Record. Reading them settled it: ADR-001 separates datasets from
# documents, ADR-002 defines the sourcing schema, ADR-003 stress-tests that schema, ADR-004 sets
# the markdown-vs-JSON rule. Every one decides how the ENGINE is built; not one decides anything
# about a job search. They must therefore be portable like any other spec.
#
# ⭐ THE FAMILIES ARE NAMED, NOT INLINED — so a family that resolves to nothing is VISIBLE.
# The old list was one flat concatenation, which is why `tasks/*.md` could stop existing (it
# became `skills/`) without anything noticing. Each family is now checked for emptiness by

          # need to change) but other than that, it should work."* It is the file most needing to be

# having never opened the other 28 — among them `scripts/*.sh` (the scripts family globs
# `*.py`), `tasks/`, `ci-setup/`, and the whole of `tests/fixtures/`, which is where a KEY
# naming the owner still sits. Three real leaks were found there by a scan written by hand in
# a scratch file, because the gate could not see them.
#
# So the file list now comes from the repository itself: **every tracked file is scanned unless
# it cannot be read as text**, and the count of each is reported. A family that matches nothing
# is still an error — that guard catches a rename — but the families no longer DECIDE what gets
# read. This is the same correction #38 made to term extraction, applied to file selection: stop
# asking a hand-written pattern what exists, and ask the thing that knows.

# ⚠️ A KNOWN EXCEPTION MUST NAME AN ISSUE, AND A STALE ONE IS AN ERROR.
#
# The alternative — quietly excluding a path — is how a gate acquires permanent blind spots.
# Each entry is reported on every run, and an entry that no longer matches anything FAILS the
# gate, so an exception cannot outlive the defect it documents.
# The steady state is empty. The first entry — a fixture KEY naming the owner (#46) — was
# removed the moment its migration shipped and the fixture was regenerated, because the
# staleness check FAILED the gate until it was. That is the mechanism working: a suppression
# cannot quietly outlive the defect it documents.
#
# #222 — `scripts/mailboxes.py` carries a small IMAP provider table (PROVIDER_HELP), one row
# per mail host this plugin walks a user through app-password setup for. One row's provider
# name is a generic mail-provider entry, not personal data — it only trips this gate because
# this owner's own profile separately lists the same company among employers encountered, so a
# legitimate provider-table string collides with a profile-derived search term.
#
# Scoped to the exact table-entry LINE via its distinctive URL fragment, deliberately NOT the
# provider's own display name and NOT the file:
#   - matching here is `term in line`, so naming only the provider (or the file) would also
#     suppress any OTHER line that named the same company for an unrelated, real reason — not
#     narrow enough.
#   - repeating the provider's display name verbatim in this comment, or in the exception's own
#     term string, puts that name back into THIS file's text — and this gate scans its own
#     source too, so the very next `--require-profile` run would flag the exception line itself
#     as a fresh leak. The identifier-matcher fix (see `scan()` above) hit the same trap over an

# ⭐⭐ AN ORDINARY ENGLISH WORD MUST NOT BECOME A SEARCH TERM ON ITS OWN — dev #144.
#
# `check_engine_purity.py --require-profile` went red on every run on this machine, and every
# hit was a false positive: `encountered()` extracted a single common word from the live profile
# (a name/company head that happens to spell an ordinary word), and `scan()`'s case-insensitive,
# identifier-aware match then fired on that SAME word wherever it occurred in ordinary engine
# prose — "trigger that reconnect ahead of time", "ahead of any possible click", "doc-ahead-of-
# code gap", "one minor ahead of the engine". None of those sentences mention the profile; the
# collision is purely lexical.
#
# The existing guards (length floor, capitalisation, platform/placeholder exclusion — see
# `encountered()` below and `test_the_contact_extractor_keeps_the_same_guards`) were never meant
# to catch this. They ask "is this shaped like a name/company", and an ordinary word capitalised
# at the head of a JSON string ("Ahead Solutions, Inc" -> head "Ahead") is shaped exactly like
# one. The class of bug is real terms that are ALSO real words — no length/case/identifier rule
# distinguishes them, because the term genuinely came from the profile and genuinely matches
# prose that has nothing to do with it.
#
# ⚠️ NO DICTIONARY PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE (Python 3.9+, stdlib only), so "is this a real word" has
# to be something shipped or something structural. A full dictionary (tens of thousands of
# entries) was considered and rejected: it is unauditable by a human reviewer, it would need its
# own update/licensing story, and it still would not tell you which words are common ENOUGH to
# collide with ordinary prose — "defenestrate" is a real word and would almost never fire.
#
# Chosen instead: a small, hand-curated, fully auditable list of CLOSED-CLASS / high-frequency
# English words (prepositions, conjunctions, common adverbs and pronouns — the vocabulary of
# ordinary sentences, not of names). It is deliberately NOT a general dictionary and deliberately
# short enough to read start to finish in a code review. Person names, company names and place
# names are essentially never drawn from this closed class, so filtering it costs almost nothing
# in real coverage while removing exactly the collision class dev #144 hit. Applied ONLY to a
# SINGLE TOKEN matching a term exactly (case-insensitive) — a multi-word term ("Ahead Logistics
# Group") is never filtered here, because two ordinary words combining into one specific phrase
# is not something prose does by accident.
# ⚠️ Three masculine object/possessive pronouns are deliberately absent from this list —
# `check_gendered_language.py` gates every shipped file at zero for exactly that pronoun family,
# and this list ships. Their feminine counterparts are outside that gate's scope and stay in.

    # accumulate, because that is where the engine puts them. The gate therefore drew zero
    # person-terms from the one file that holds people, and a contact named in a portable file
    # was invisible to it.
    #
    # ⚠️ It certified exactly that: four real third-party names survived across `daily-run`'s
    # SKILL.md, `docs/schema.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `migrate_contacts.py`,
    # `reconcile.py` and `test_checks.py` through every green run — every one of them a person
    # in this array. Same signature failure as the two above it: a source that is never read
    # produces an empty term set, and an empty term set reads as CLEAN.
    #
    # `outreach[].to` is deliberately NOT read here: it is the free text that
    # `migrate_contacts.py` exists to normalise INTO `contacts[].name`, and every person it
    # names has a contact record after that migration. Reading the canonical field is the
    # point; reading the messy one as well would only add malformed variants.
