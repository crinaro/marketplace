"""A draft's send-precondition, as data instead of prose. Resolves against the pipeline.

⭐ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (GitHub issue #6)
-------------------------------------------
A multi-part sequence stages part A (sent) and part B (held until the recipient accepts or
replies). The precondition on part B lived in `**Status:**` prose, so **the dashboard rendered
every staged draft under a heading meaning "awaiting your approval to send"** — including the ones
the candidate cannot act on at all. One observed state: seven items presented as needing them, one
genuinely actionable.

That inverts the surface. The decision surface's invariant is that a Your Move line must read as a question
or an imperative aimed at the candidate, and **a draft that cannot be sent yet is neither**. The
predictable result is that the candidate learns to skim the one list that is supposed to be unskippable.

⭐⭐ AND THE DATA WAS ALREADY THERE. Every outreach touch carries `outcome`
(awaiting/accepted/replied/…), `responded_on`, `contact_id` and `message_ref`. The system could
always answer *"has this person accepted or replied?"* — what was missing was any machine-readable
link from the draft to the touch it waits on. **A missing join, not missing information**, which
is why this is cheap to fix and expensive to leave.

## The general rule this is the first instance of

    ⭐ A FACT A RUN KNOWS GOES INTO THE QUERYABLE STORE, NEVER INTO NARRATIVE.

Issues #4 and #5 are the same defect in different clothes — a coverage gap in a run-log narrative,
a run's findings in a session buffer that never reaches disk. The engine has solved it once before:
open fit questions carried urgency in prose until `act_by` made it a sortable field. This module is
that move applied to drafts, and the shape is meant to be copied rather than re-invented.

## The field

One meta line in the draft entry, alongside `**Medium:**` and the rest:

    **Blocked until:** contact:dana-holbrook outcome:accepted|replied

`contact:` is a `contact_id` as it appears in `contacts[]`. `outcome:` is one or more values from
the outreach outcome enum, `|`-separated. The draft is **sendable** when any outreach touch to that
contact has one of those outcomes.

⚠️ **An unparseable value is reported, never guessed.** A precondition nobody can read is worse
than none: it looks handled and is not. `--check` fails on one, so a typo surfaces at run start
rather than by a draft silently sitting in the wrong group.

## ⭐ THE LEGACY PROSE FORM IS DETECTED, NEVER TREATED AS ABSENT (GitHub issue #13)

The first release of this module shipped the field with no migration and no enforcement, so a
profile predating it kept its preconditions in prose — and this tool reported every one of those
drafts **sendable, "no precondition"**. Four drafts saying *in their own titles* that they were
held pending someone's acceptance rendered as `9 sendable, 0 blocked`. A false green is worse
than the prose it replaced, because it stops anyone looking.

The root error: "no draft is blocked" and "no draft has been migrated" are opposite states, and
absence-of-field rendered them identically. So now:

- a draft whose text carries a **hold phrase** (`HOLD_RE`) but no structured field is state
  `unresolved` — a migration gap, named as such, never sendable;
- `**Blocked until:** unresolved`, which `migrate.py`'s 0.18.0 migration writes under each
  detected prose hold, is the same state as durable data rather than a heuristic re-match;
- `--check` fails on `unresolved` exactly as on `unreadable`, and the summary reports the count.

The way out of `unresolved` is a human (or the drafting agent) replacing it with the real join:
`contact:<contact_id> outcome:<...>` — or, for a false positive, rewording the prose. The
default direction is deliberate: the cheap error is a draft waiting for a look, the expensive
one is a blocked draft presented as actionable.

## ⭐ A TERMINAL STATUS ENDS AN ENTRY — IT MUST NOT NEED A SECOND STEP (public #29)

The panel derivation used to answer one question only — *is this blocked on someone else?* — and
never asked whether the entry was **already over**. A draft's `**Status:**` line already carries
that fact (`SENT 2026-08-20 — remove at next weekly pass`, `MOOT / DO-NOT-SEND — role closed`),
written by the send-recording flow or by whoever decided the role was dead — but nothing here
read it, so a sent or moot entry kept reporting `state: sendable, "no precondition"` and rendered
under Ready to send forever, exactly like a genuinely pending message. The **removal** side of
the bug was the same shape as issue #6's "needs a second, separate step" failure: retiring the
markdown entry was left to a later weekly pass, and a moot outcome had no removal path AT ALL.

The fix does not add a removal step — it removes the NEED for one. `TERMINAL_RE` recognises the
Status line's own terminal words and reports `state: "sent"` / `"moot"` directly, so a consumer
that excludes `TERMINAL` from what it renders is derived, not maintained: the entry disappears
from the queue the moment its own Status line says it is done, with no second write required.
The physical markdown entry may still be cleaned up later (or never) — it no longer matters,
because nothing that reads `precondition.report()` is fooled by its presence.

⚠️ **Deliberately conservative on SENT.** `SENT_RE` only matches a Status line that STARTS with
`sent` — never one that merely CONTAINS it. "PART A SENT · part B pending" is a legitimate,
still-actionable mid-sequence state (`check_sent_drafts.py`'s own docstring names it), and must
keep rendering; only a status that OPENS with "sent" is asserting the whole entry is done.

## ⭐ COVER LETTERS ARE COVERED TOO — THE PAIR IS A PAIR EVERYWHERE (dev #169)

This module originally parsed `drafts.md` alone, while `check_sent_drafts.py` and the dashboard
treated `drafts.md` / `cover_letters.md` as siblings. The consequence was the dangerous half of
that asymmetry: **a cover letter carrying a send-hold rendered as READY** on the one artifact
that leaves the building — not blocked, not an error, ready. `FILES` below owns the pair;
`report()` walks every file in it and tags each row with `file`, so consumers group per file
instead of assuming everything is a draft. The loudness rules are identical for both files: a
prose hold is `unresolved`, an unreadable field is `unreadable`, and `--check` fails on either
wherever it lives.

Usage:
    python3 precondition.py            # every entry: sendable / blocked / unresolved / unreadable
    python3 precondition.py --json
    python3 precondition.py --check    # exit 1 on an unparseable or unresolved precondition
