WHERE AM I RUNNING, AND WHAT CAN I ACTUALLY DO?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-04: *"I want a multi-agent experience that's distributed."* An audit of the
capability split found that **exactly ONE thing is irreducibly bound to the desktop** — LinkedIn
authenticated browsing, because it needs a real logged-in Chrome and there is no API. Gmail is a
credentials-placement decision, and everything else (research, drafting, every script, the
dashboard, git) already runs anywhere.

So the architecture is not "make the coordinator run everywhere." It is: **the repo is the
coordinator, and sessions are workers that attach to it with different capabilities.** A worker
must therefore be able to answer *what can I do here?* before it claims work.

    ⚠️ THE POINT IS TO STOP GUESSING. Until now, capability was implicit: a run assumed Chrome was
    there, tried, and reported BROWSER UNAVAILABLE on failure. That is fine for one machine and
    useless for routing — you cannot decide who should take a task by having everyone attempt it.

## What it probes, and how — never by assumption

    repo        the git repo is present and readable        (the bus itself)
    python      scripts run                                 (deterministic core)
    keychain    the OS credential store has IMAP creds      (Gmail scans — any platform,
                                                             token name kept for queue compat)
    chrome      the extension's MCP server is configured    (⭐ the desktop lock)
    browser     an unauthenticated browser pane exists      (research)

**`chrome` is deliberately conservative.** It reports the CONFIGURED capability, not a live
handshake — a probe cannot tell whether the browser will answer, and a worker that claims
LinkedIn work on an optimistic probe is worse than one that never claims it. The runtime check
stays where it belongs: `linkedin-runner` calls `list_connected_browsers` and returns
BROWSER UNAVAILABLE. This answers *"could this environment ever do LinkedIn work?"*, not
*"will it work right now?"*

Usage:
    python3 scripts/whoami.py              # human-readable capability report
    python3 scripts/whoami.py --json       # machine-readable, for routing
    python3 scripts/whoami.py --can chrome # exit 0 if capable, 1 if not

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.

    changed. Before this, the probe answered False on every non-Mac, so a capable Linux or

    indistinguishable from one that is.
