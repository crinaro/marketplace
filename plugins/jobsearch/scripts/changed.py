Did the data move under me? — the staleness check for a long-running session.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02: *"How does the long running session know to execute its process when data was
updated?"*

**The honest mechanics first, because they constrain the answer.** A Claude session is
**turn-driven**: it cannot wake itself, poll, or watch a file. So "the session knows" can only
mean one of two things:

  **(a) something DELIVERS A TURN to it** — `notifyOnCompletion` on a scheduled task. That is a
      genuine wake, and the only one available. **But only a REGULAR session can claim it** (a
      scheduled run is refused: *"it ends when the run does"*), so the candidate claims it directly, and
      re-claims it each time they open a new coordinator session.

  **(b) it CHECKS at the start of a turn** — which needs something to compare against. That is
      this script.

**Why (b) matters even with (a) working, and it is not a nicety.** A background run can write
state *while the candidate is mid-conversation* — their session read `data/*.jsonl` several turns ago and is
reasoning from that. A notification tells the candidate a run *finished*; it does not tell their session that
the ground it is standing on moved. **Acting on a stale read is a correctness bug, not a missed
alert** — it is how a session would confidently re-draft an outreach note for a reply that already
arrived.

So: the coordinator records a **watermark** of what it last saw, and can ask this script at any
time whether anything changed since. Cheap — size + mtime, no parsing, no hashing of large files.

    ⚠️ THIS DOES NOT MAKE THE SESSION AUTONOMOUS. Nothing here polls. It answers a question when
    asked. The convention that makes it useful is: **check before you write — AND before you
    REPORT.**

    ⭐ "BEFORE YOU WRITE" WAS TOO NARROW, 2026-08-04. A session ended a long stretch of tooling
    work by telling the candidate a reply still needed drafting. It had been sent and recorded
    eight hours earlier by a concurrent run; the watermark said STALE the whole time and was
    never consulted, because the rule only mentioned writes. **Reporting stale state costs the
    same as writing it** — the candidate acted on "you still owe Alex a reply" after already sending it.
    Run this before any status summary, not just before an edit.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/changed.py --mark       # record what I'm seeing now (after reading state)
    python3 scripts/changed.py              # has anything moved since the mark? exit 1 if yes
    python3 scripts/changed.py --verbose    # show which files, and how

# whole coordinator + background design is about concurrent sessions.
#
# Found while answering the candidate's question "do I need to run /coordinator to get the update": their
# session marked the watermark at 06:41; my work overwrote it at 07:15; their session then asked
# "did anything move since I looked?" and got **"UNCHANGED since 07:15 — safe to write."** That
