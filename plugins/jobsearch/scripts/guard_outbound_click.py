"""PreToolUse guard: DENY a ref-based click that resolves to an outbound-terminal control.

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (dev #78 / public #9)
-----------------------------------------
A click that sends a message, invitation or application under the candidate's identity is
the LEAST REVERSIBLE act in this system. `guard_engine_writes.py` gives an engine-file write
a mechanical guard on top of the behavioural rule; a push gets one too (adr-005). An outbound
click had neither — the prohibition on clicking Send/Connect/Apply lived only as prose inside
a browser-driving agent's own prompt (`linkedin-runner.md`), which is exactly the shape of
control that does not survive a session that is mid-task and confident. This is that guard.

⚠️ THIS IS A GUARD, NOT A SANDBOX — same posture as `guard_engine_writes.py`, not relitigated
here. It matches the two browser-control channels `linkedin-runner` actually routes to (the
in-app Browser pane and `claude-in-chrome`), each covered on both its single-click surface and
its batch surface. A determined session with a coordinate click, a JS executor, or a channel
this plugin does not route to can still send something. **The behavioural rule remains the
first line**; this stops the reflexive click, which is the one that actually happens. See "WHAT
THIS DOES NOT COVER" below — read it before trusting this guard further than it goes.

## The test, stated once

DENY when a ref-based click resolves — via the transcript's most recent page-read output, in
THIS agent's own chain — to an element whose accessible name matches an outbound-terminal verb
(send, connect, invite, apply, submit application, InMail, post, share). Third-party-directed
verbs only: "Save" on the candidate's own profile is deliberately OUTSIDE the pattern, because
the approved-edit path (profile-optimizer drafts, the candidate applies it directly) is a
different and recoverable act.

    click has no `ref` (coordinate click)                       -> ALLOW (outside v1 — see below)
    ref does not resolve in this chain's most recent page read   -> ALLOW, loud (systemMessage)
    resolved accessible name matches an outbound-terminal verb   -> DENY
    anything else                                                -> ALLOW

## The matcher — GUARDED_CLICK_TOOLS is the single source of truth

`hooks.json`'s PreToolUse matcher for this script must equal `"|".join(GUARDED_CLICK_TOOLS)`
exactly. `check_click_guard_matcher.py` asserts that, both as a normal CI gate and inside
`check_shipped_package.py`'s materialized package (drift control, not relitigated here).

⭐ A `browser_batch` call runs a SEQUENCE of `computer` actions inside one call
(`tool_input["actions"] = [{"name": "computer", "input": {...}}, ...]`). A guard that only
inspects the top-level `tool_input` lets a Send click through inside a batch — this script
iterates `tool_input["actions"]` and classifies every `computer` item in it. This is the single
most important behavioural case in this guard; `TestBrowserBatchIteration` in test_checks.py
exists because reverting the iteration is exactly the kind of change that looks like a harmless
simplification.

⚠️ dev #310 — **BOTH surfaces' batch tools, not just one.** `mcp__claude-in-chrome__browser_batch`
was in `GUARDED_CLICK_TOOLS` from the start; `mcp__Claude_Browser__browser_batch` — the in-app
Browser pane's own batch call, and per `linkedin-runner.md` the PREFERRED surface, "TRY FIRST
for every capability" — was not, on either side of the drift check: absent from this tuple,
absent from `hooks.json`'s matcher, absent from ADR-015's own prose, absent from every test. The
matcher-drift gate (`check_click_guard_matcher.py`) only proves the two files agree with EACH
OTHER; it cannot notice a tool that is consistently missing from both. A click nested inside
that call bypassed this guard entirely — not "ALLOW, loud" like an unresolvable ref, but never
routed to this script at all, and therefore never classified, never logged, never noted. Fixed
by adding it to `GUARDED_CLICK_TOOLS` (below) and to `BATCH_TOOLS`, the set `iter_click_inputs`
checks membership against instead of a single hardcoded name.

Deliberately NOT in the matcher, each for a stated reason: `form_input` (sets values, does not
click — an accepted v1 gap, see below); a JS executor on any server (a programmatic click
carries no ref and no accessible name — nothing to classify); a browser controller the user
installs outside this plugin (a shipped matcher cannot enumerate it; this guard covers the two
channels `linkedin-runner` routes to, single-click and batch alike).

## Ref resolution, and the concurrent-agent hazard

Claude Code's transcript (`transcript_path` in the hook payload — JSONL, one record per line,
`message.content[].type == "tool_use"` / `"tool_result"`, each record carrying `uuid` and
`parentUuid`) does not tell this script which tool_use IS the click being classified. This
script anchors on the LAST record whose message contains a `tool_use` block named in
`GUARDED_CLICK_TOOLS` — true whenever the hook fires immediately after the model's own turn was
appended, which is the overwhelmingly common case, but not a guarantee against a concurrent
subagent finishing and writing a later record into the SAME transcript file in the interval
between. There is no chain identifier in the hook payload that would close that gap completely;
noted here rather than hidden.

From that anchor, resolution walks `parentUuid` BACKWARD — never scans the file by proximity —
so a parallel subagent's interleaved writes (a different, unrelated `parentUuid` lineage) are
never picked up as "the most recent read." Where the click carries a `tabId`, only a page read
with a matching `tabId` counts; where it carries none (the in-app pane has one tab), no tab
filter applies. **Unresolvable is unresolvable — never a cross-page guess.** An unresolved ref
allows the click and attaches a `systemMessage` saying so; it never denies on a guess and never
silently allows either.

## WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER — state it, don't let a reader assume more than what's here

- **A coordinate click carries no ref.** Nothing to resolve, nothing to classify. Allowed,
  unconditionally. `browser_batch`'s own tool description warns its coordinates refer to a
  PRE-BATCH screenshot, which makes batch clicks disproportionately coordinate-based — i.e.
  disproportionately in this hole.
- **Enter-to-send in a compose box.** A `key` event carries no ref and no focus context in v1.
- **`form_input`.** Sets a field value; never clicks. Out of the matcher by design (above).
- **A JS executor on any server.** A programmatic click carries no ref — nothing to classify.
- **S6 (the scheduled/unattended cloud worker).** Whether hooks execute there at all is
  UNVERIFIED, and a stale Home-shadow install can silently run an older version of this file
  that predates the guard. **Assume UNGUARDED on S6.** The prose prohibition in
  `linkedin-runner.md` is the only control there — do not delete it because this script exists.

## `--selftest`, run from `SessionStart`

Without this the guard is unsound EVERYWHERE, because it cannot tell its own presence from its
absence: a broken parser and an absent transcript look identical from the outside (zero output
either way), and this is the plugin's FIRST transcript consumer, so nothing else would notice a
format shift. `--selftest` (a) classifies a click against an embedded, synthesized fixture
transcript, proving the parser and the verb pattern against a known shape, and (b) opens the
LIVE `transcript_path` from the SessionStart payload and asserts its envelope parses. On
failure it prints a `systemMessage`: the guard is inert on this surface, browser sends are
unguarded. It never blocks startup — same fail-open posture as the click path.

## dev #102 — two distinct ways the transcript lookup can fail, and a known-inert surface must
## stay loud, not just announce itself once

Reported from a real machine, twice, on different days: the selftest could not open the
transcript it derived, and — because the LIVE click path (`evaluate()`) reads
`payload.get("transcript_path")` the same way — every click on that surface was unresolvable
and therefore allowed. Two different bugs hide behind that one report:

1. **The payload can carry no `transcript_path` at all.** `resolve_transcript_path()` now falls
   back to `derive_fallback_transcript_path()` — the observed on-disk layout,
   `~/.claude/projects/<cwd with "/" -> "-">/<session_id>.jsonl` — when the key is absent or
   empty. ⚠️ This is a **guess from an undocumented convention**, not the contract: Claude Code
   promises nothing about it, so `diagnose_transcript()` still has to prove the derived path
   actually opens and parses before anything relies on it, exactly as it would the payload's own
   value. A path the payload DOES supply is never second-guessed through the fallback — a
   present-but-broken value is itself informative (see next point) and guessing over it would
   destroy that information.
2. **A path is present but cannot be opened or does not parse.** `diagnose_transcript()` (shared
   by `--selftest` and the live click path, so the two can never disagree about what "inert"
   means) captures the real exception type and message rather than a bare "failed", and
   separately distinguishes a legitimately empty fresh transcript (fine) from one whose lines
   are present but NONE match the expected envelope (a format shift — not fine).

**The design gap this closes:** the fail-open policy for one unresolvable click is unchanged —
an unclassifiable click still allows and reports. But before this fix, "the guard cannot resolve
anything on this surface" degraded to a single `systemMessage` at `SessionStart` and then
SILENCE: every later click that could not classify only got the same generic per-click note
("no resolvable page-read... for ref X"), indistinguishable from an ordinary one-off ambiguity.
`evaluate()` now re-derives `diagnose_transcript()`'s verdict on every single invocation (no
persisted state to go stale) and, when it says the surface is unusable, every click's note
carries the loud, distinct "GUARD INERT on this surface" wording instead of the generic one —
on EVERY click, not once at startup. Whether a known-inert guard should refuse rather than warn
is a fail-open POLICY decision, left untouched here — see the hand-back for dev #102.

## dev #111 — the guard's status is QUERYABLE, never only loud in the moment

dev #102 made an inert guard loud on every click — and still only inside the session where it
happened. Nothing could answer "has this install had an inert guard for two days?"; the one
reporter who knew (public #12) knew because they personally noticed across two sessions. That is
this marketplace's recurring defect — a fact a run already knows written into a scrolling
advisory instead of the queryable store — and the fix copies the established shape (`act_by`,
`precondition.py`, `blocked_until`): a named field, a strict reader that refuses what it cannot
parse, and a resolver against data that already exists.

- **Every selftest, and the first click-path diagnosis per session (or any state change),
  records a coded `guard_status` event** via `_diag.py` — the diagnostics log that carries no
  user data by construction, so the record can be pasted into an issue as-is. Fields are CODES
  (`state`: ok|inert, `source`: selftest|click, `reason`: no-transcript-path | open-failed |
  format-shift | fixture-fail | ok), never the prose detail — the prose stays in the session's
  own systemMessage where it already is. Recording is best-effort and can never change a
  verdict or block a click.
- **`guard_status()` answers the operator's question from that record**: ACTIVE / INERT (since
  when, across how many sessions) / UNKNOWN (no observation yet) / BROKEN (not registered in
  hooks.json, or the parser fixture fails — inert EVERYWHERE, not just one surface). `doctor`
  and `whoami` carry this line, as `docs/deployment.md` specified in the #78 audit;
  `--status` prints it standalone.
- ⚠️ **A status line that says "live" against an inert guard is worse than no line** — so the
  verdict is derived only from recorded observations and the executable fixture, never from
  the guard file merely existing. `TestOutboundClickGuardStatus` proves the INERT verdict
  against a genuinely unopenable transcript (the exact Errno-2 reproduction from a real
  SessionStart), and was watched fail against an induced always-ACTIVE bug before shipping.
- ⚠️ **Whether a known-inert guard should refuse rather than warn is still the owner's open
  fail-open policy decision** — dev #111 says so explicitly. Nothing here changes the guard's
  verdict on any click; this only makes the inertness durable and queryable.

## dev #137 — `claude -p --chrome`'s selftest was never actually inert; SessionStart just asked
## the question before it could possibly have an answer

Filed as "the one S3 mode with click tools is the one where the guard is inert" — the selftest's
FAIL was real, but the conclusion drawn from it was not established. Probed directly (CLI
2.1.231, three independent `claude -p --chrome` sessions, 2026-08-18) to settle it:

- **The transcript is neither absent nor at a different path.** The payload's own
  `transcript_path` is exactly `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session_id>.jsonl` — the same
  convention `derive_fallback_transcript_path()` already encodes — and after the session ends
  that exact file exists and parses cleanly. **Failure mode 2 fired** (dev #102's "present but
  cannot be opened" — `FileNotFoundError`), never mode 1 (no `transcript_path` in the payload).
- **It is not a rare race — it is deterministic, and unfixable by waiting inside the hook.** A
  SessionStart hook that polls its own `transcript_path` for up to 8.5s (nearly the whole 10s
  hook timeout) never observes the file. A lightweight hook that returns immediately does see it
  — but only ~3s later, from OUTSIDE the hook, once the model's first turn begins. This proves
  transcript creation is gated on EVERY SessionStart hook returning, not on elapsed time: no
  retry loop inside `--selftest` can ever close this gap, on this surface, by construction.
- **The real click-time guard is unaffected.** `evaluate()` re-derives `diagnose_transcript()`
  fresh on every invocation (dev #102), and a click's `PreToolUse` fires from the same hook
  plumbing as any other tool's. Proxied with `Bash` (no click tool was ever given to a probe
  child — see the hand-back for the discipline this followed): the transcript already has
  content at the FIRST `PreToolUse` of the session, well before a click could plausibly be the
  session's very first tool call. **The guard was never actually inert when it mattered.**

The defect worth fixing, then, was not the guard's classification — it was dev #111's own
durable record believing the SessionStart false negative. Recording "inert" from a transcript
that merely doesn't exist YET would durably and systematically mislabel every `-p` session, which
is the false-positive twin of the missing-observation problem dev #111 was built to solve: **a
wrong fact in the queryable store is worse than no fact**, because it reads as researched truth.

`transcript_pending_creation()` recognizes this ONE narrow condition — `FileNotFoundError` on a
path that independently matches this same payload's own `derive_fallback_transcript_path()`
result, i.e. Claude Code's own addressing convention, never a guess — and both `--selftest` and
the click path skip the durable "inert" record for it, staying loud in-session with honest
wording instead. Every existing dev #102 / dev #111 regression fixture uses a payload without a
matching `session_id` + `cwd`, so none of them can satisfy this condition; a genuinely wrong or
broken transcript path — the shape those fixtures exist to prove — still records "inert"
immediately, unchanged. Fail-open posture: **completely untouched** — every affected click was
already being ALLOWed before this fix and still is; only the recording and the wording changed.

Deliberately NOT in `whoami.py`'s capability set: `whoami` declares capability for CLAIMING
work; this is a safety net, not a capability, and a probe result must never gate whether the
hook runs. `whoami` prints the status line OUTSIDE its capabilities block, and `--can` does
not accept it.

Protocol: PreToolUse stdin is the hook payload; exit 2 blocks and stderr is shown to the model
(same as `guard_engine_writes.py`). `--selftest` never blocks; it prints and exits 0 always.
⭐⭐ FAILS OPEN, ALWAYS on internal error — a guard that breaks all browsing is worse than the
failure it prevents.

    dev #102: `diagnose_transcript()` is re-derived on THIS invocation, fresh, every time — no
    persisted "the selftest failed at startup" flag to go stale. When it says the surface is
    unusable, that is exactly the condition the SessionStart selftest would also hit, so an
    unresolved click's note is escalated to the loud "GUARD INERT" wording rather than the
    generic per-click ambiguity note — and because this runs per hook invocation, that escalation
    happens on EVERY click while the condition persists, not once at startup.

    dev #137: unless `transcript_pending_creation()` says this specific unusable-ness is just the
    transcript not existing YET (see its docstring) — in which case the note says so honestly
    instead of claiming "GUARD INERT", because that claim would usually be false: proven, the
    transcript is reliably present by the time any tool's PreToolUse fires, well before a click
    could plausibly be the very first tool call of a session.

    dev #309 — a SUBAGENT's click (`payload["agent_id"]` present) resolves against the
    SUBAGENT'S OWN transcript (`derive_subagent_transcript_path()`), never the main session's:
    the main `transcript_path` this hook otherwise reads structurally cannot contain a
    subagent's own tool-use records, so every subagent click used to fall through to the
    generic "unresolved -> ALLOW, loud" branch — not rarely, but on every single one, which is
    exactly the shape the module docstring's fail-open defence does not hold for. Two changes,
    both scoped to `agent_id is not None`:
      1. Resolve and diagnose the subagent's own transcript instead of the main one.
      2. Narrow fail-open for this context specifically: a click with NO resolvable page-read
         at all (`page_text is None` — no read tool call found anywhere in the subagent's own
         chain) is DENIED, not allowed — a browser-driving agent clicking with no visible page
         is refused rather than trusted blind. A page-read that DID resolve but happens not to
         contain THIS particular ref (a stale ref, the page changed) stays ordinary per-click
         ambiguity — ALLOW, loud — unchanged from the main-session behaviour; only total
         blindness is escalated to DENY. The main session's own fail-open posture is completely
         untouched: dev #309 is scoped to `agent_id`, and an unresolvable main-session click
         still ALLOWs and reports exactly as before.

    ⚠️ `agent_id`'s presence on a subagent's `PreToolUse` payload is corroborated from Claude
    Code's own changelog ("Added `agent_id` ... to hook events" for subagents), not independently
    re-verified here against a live-fired subagent hook — this dispatch's constraints prohibit
    opening a real browser or driving a real browser-driving subagent to check. Treat this as
    INFERRED, not TESTED, per the standing rule on that distinction; state it in any report
    rather than letting it read as measured.

    ⚠️ Left deliberately out of scope: dev #111/#137's durable `guard_status` recording (below,
    in `main_hook()`) stays tied to the MAIN transcript's health — `_LAST_DIAGNOSIS` is left
    `None` on the subagent path, on purpose, so a subagent-transcript-specific hiccup is never
    folded into the surface-wide ACTIVE/INERT verdict, which would conflate two different
    failure shapes. A subagent-scoped equivalent of that durable record is not built here."""
