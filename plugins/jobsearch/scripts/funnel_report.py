"""What's actually working: channel yield, application outcomes, outreach reply rates.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-21)
----------------------------
The candidate: "We should be tracking who we connected with & when i applied to analyze
what works and what doesnt."

Two things were in the way, both fixed the same day:

  1. Applications were stuffed into `outreach[]` with a person-shaped `to` field
     reading "<a recognizable employer> careers (direct ATS application)". Counting applications meant
     string-matching a free-text name, and an ATS submission looked identical to a
     networking note. They are different funnels -- an application's measure is
     "did anyone respond", outreach's is "did they reply" -- so they now live in
     separate arrays.
  2. `contacts[]` had been backfilled from markdown prose, so ~33 of its entries
     were placeholders ("N/A -- not pursued", "None found", "Not yet checked")
     sitting in the `name` field, every one typed `path_type: recruiter`. Averages
     over that are worse than no number at all.

This reads data/opportunities.jsonl and reports only what the data can actually
support. Where the sample is too small to mean anything, it says so rather than
printing a confident percentage over n=3.

    `communications.default_sequence` configures the media sent together on the first touch —
    it says nothing about which medium a chase or a reply-thread uses — so a cut pooled across
    every touch_type compares default_sequence against a mixed bag it was never a proposal
    about, and a medium used mostly for chases (already-engaged recipients) can outscore one
    used mostly for cold first touches on data that supports no such comparison.

      * n >= MIN_SAMPLE **resolved** in each arm — sends are not evidence, and with 5-10
        samples a "winner" is usually noise;
      * a gap of at least MIN_GAP_PP percentage points.
