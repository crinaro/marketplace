"""Are the two narrative files still MACHINE-READABLE?

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS
------------------
`presence/claims.md` (the claim union, formerly resume.md) and `presence/projects.md` are human-edited by design — they are the candidate's own prose and
must stay that way. But two conventions inside them are load-bearing for the ENGINE, and until
now nothing checked either one:

    projects.md   every proof point carries a `**Surface when:**` trigger. Eight agents and
                  skills GREP for it. That grep is how a project reaches a draft at all.

    claims.md     an `Additional Detail` addenda section holds facts confirmed but deliberately
                  not printed. Agents check it before concluding a fact is unavailable.

**Neither is validated by `validate_data.py`** — that gates the four JSONL files and only mentions
these two in prose. So the conventions that make the files usable were enforced by nothing.

## ⚠️ THE FAILURE IS SILENT, WHICH IS WHY IT NEEDS A GATE

Reword the heading, or write `Surface if:`, or drop a colon, and every grep returns nothing. The
run does not error. It reports *no matching proof points* — which is exactly what it reports when
the candidate genuinely has none. **A malformed trigger and an empty file are indistinguishable
downstream**, and the cost lands on the one artifact that most needs the evidence: the draft.

⚠️ **Honest scope: on the profile it was written against, this found NOTHING broken** — 38
well-formed triggers and no defects. It is a guard against a class of failure that has not
happened yet, not a fix for one that had. Said plainly because the opposite claim is the kind
this project keeps having to unpick: a first draft of this header asserted it had caught a real
malformed trigger, which came from misreading a legitimate parenthetical variant as a defect.

## What is a FAILURE and what is a NOTE

**FAIL** — a trigger line whose bold never closes (`**Surface when: foo` with no `:**`). The
`**` runs on, the trigger text is swallowed into the bold run, and what a reader sees is a
formatting smudge rather than a missing hook.

**FAIL** — `claims.md` with no `Additional Detail` heading at all. Agents check the addenda
before concluding a fact is unavailable; without the heading that check silently finds nothing.

**NOTE** — an entry with no trigger. Some sections legitimately are not proof points (a list of
open questions, for instance), so this cannot be an error without producing a permanent false
positive — and a gate that cries wolf is a gate somebody switches off.

**DELIBERATELY NOT A FAILURE** — a variant like `**Surface when (add to the triggers above):**`.
It is line-initial, it closes its bold, and it is findable. Narrowing the rule to one exact
string would break a form the candidate chose on purpose, which is not this gate's business.

⚠️ This checker does NOT read the content of either file beyond its structure, and it never
prints a proof point. Structure is engine business; the content is the candidate's.

Usage:
    check_narrative.py            # exit 1 if a convention is broken
    check_narrative.py --verbose  # show every trigger it found, by line

# ⭐ ONLY LINE-INITIAL TRIGGERS COUNT — and getting this wrong makes the gate useless.

# The first version matched the words "surface when" anywhere on a line. It reported five
# failures against a healthy file: three were PROSE ABOUT the convention (the file's own header
# explaining it, in backticks), one was the ordinary English verb ("surface for any role
# where..."), and only one was a real defect. A gate with a 4-in-5 false-positive rate is a gate
# that gets ignored, which is worse than no gate — so the shape is now anchored.

# A trigger is a line that BEGINS (after optional list marker) with a bold `Surface when`.
