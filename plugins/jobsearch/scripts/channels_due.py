"""The sourcing queue: which channels are due for review, from data/channels.jsonl.

Turns sourcing from "remember to check Dice" into a data-driven loop. Run at the
start of every daily/weekly run: it lists the active-search channels that are due
(cadence + last_reviewed), the recruiter relationships that have gone quiet, and
after reviewing a channel you stamp its last_reviewed so it drops off the queue.

    python3 scripts/channels_due.py                 # what's due today
    python3 scripts/channels_due.py --stamp <id>    # mark <id> reviewed today (--date YYYY-MM-DD to override)

IMPORTANT — what "review a channel" means (the 2026-07-20 clarification):
  Active-search channels are reviewed by DIRECT SEARCH on the source's own job
  pages (LinkedIn Jobs, Dice, Indeed, BuiltIn) plus organizations' own career
  pages/ATS — NOT by reading the source's algorithmic ALERT EMAILS, which are
  noise. Recruiters are reviewed on-inbound (a human reached out) and by not
  letting an open thread go silent.

Date handling: pass --today YYYY-MM-DD (the runtime forbids Date.now-style calls
being assumed; scripts should be handed the date). Defaults to the system date.

Targets Python 3.9+, stdlib only.

# review's central question, reachable by CLI alone while the dashboard rendered none of it.
