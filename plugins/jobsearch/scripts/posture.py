"""What may this run do? Reads the ACTIVE posture and reports its budget.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-05)
----------------------------
The owner: *"i want to support multiple tiers, that could be a configuration of the user so it
works according to their budget."*

Cost in this system is almost entirely **runs per day x agents per run**. Deterministic sweeps are
free at any tier. So the tier is not a mode in the code — it is two numbers and a permission list,
and the engine reads them rather than hard-coding a cadence.

⭐ A RUN MUST ASK THIS BEFORE SPAWNING AN AGENT. The prompt cannot know which tier it is on, and
"just one quick research pass" is exactly how a token budget dies quietly.

Postures ship as DATA in `config.json` (`search.postures`), so a user can retune one or add their
own without touching the engine. The engine reads the knobs, never the name.

    python3 scripts/posture.py              # what am I allowed to do?
    python3 scripts/posture.py --may research
    python3 scripts/posture.py --cron       # the cron line this posture implies

Advisory; always exits 0 except for an explicit --may miss (exit 1) so a run can branch on it.
Python 3.9+, stdlib only.
