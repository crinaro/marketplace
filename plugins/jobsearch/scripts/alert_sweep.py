"""
Deterministic daily job-alert sweep — the reliable catch for board/aggregator
alert emails (Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice, CareerBuilder, Ladders).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Three consecutive daily runs (2026-07-22..24) had the `inbox-scan` agent (haiku)
report the job-alert emails "silent" when a daily Indeed alert had in fact
arrived squarely inside the window — each time the main session's own direct
`gmail_search` found it, and each time the candidate or the main session caught the miss,
not the agent. The lesson recorded in CLAUDE.md's token-discipline rule is that
a *daily, predictable* artifact like the Indeed alert is deterministic work that
belongs in a query, not a model summary. This script IS that query, promoted out
of a focus.md note (weekly-review proposal P3, approved 2026-07-27) into code so
it is never re-typed and never quietly skipped.

It does NOT judge fit — it surfaces the alert artifacts and their roles so the
run reads them itself. inbox-scan stays useful for human/recruiter mail and
meeting artifacts; this replaces it ONLY for the predictable alert digests.

Reuses mail_client.py's Keychain + IMAP plumbing (a pure library — the MCP
server lives in the gmail-multi connector plugin). Same coverage guarantee: EVERY configured
account by default, and an unreachable account is a LOUD banner, never a silent zero —
so this can never conclude "no alerts" from a one-mailbox view.

⭐ THE SENDER LIST COMES FROM data/channels.jsonl, NOT A CONSTANT (GitHub #147, dev #147)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This used to hardcode `from:indeed OR from:linkedin OR ...` as a Python constant. Retiring an
aggregator channel in the store (`relationship_status: retired`, the same field
`channels_due.py` already honors) had NO EFFECT on this sweep — the retirement decision and
the sweep's source list lived in two disconnected places, so a dead source kept surfacing
digests forever. That is the standing rule about shipping a version rather than an
instruction, pointed at configuration: **retiring a channel must stop the sweep with no
engine code edit.**

Each channel that produces alert-digest emails now carries its own `alert_sender` field (the
Gmail search fragment for THAT channel's From address, e.g. `from:indeed`) — see
`docs/schema.md`. `_channel_senders()` below collects every non-retired channel's
`alert_sender` and ORs them together. A channel with no `alert_sender` (a recruiter, a
company-site channel reviewed by direct search, ...) is simply not an alert-digest source and
is silently skipped — that is correct, not a gap.

The one piece that stayed a script constant: `SUBJECT_FALLBACK`, a generic subject match for
digests whose From address varies (rotating subdomains, ESP relays). That is a fact about how
alert digests are IDENTIFIED in general, not a fact any one channel's record could hold — no
channel "owns" it — so moving it into the store would invent a field with nothing to key it
to. Only the sender list was ever channel-specific; the subject fallback stays here.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/alert_sweep.py                 # last 1 day (the daily default)
    python3 scripts/alert_sweep.py --days 2        # widen the window
    python3 scripts/alert_sweep.py --account you@example.com     # narrow (rare)

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.
