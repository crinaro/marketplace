"""
Work that needs the LAPTOP — queued from anywhere, executed where the resources are.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The candidate, 2026-08-02: *"How does the coordinator connect with resources only available on the laptop
such as send a LinkedIn message through the chrome extension?"*

**The blunt answer: it doesn't, and everything in this system is laptop-bound.** The repo, the
Gmail credentials (macOS Keychain, service `claudesearch-imap`), `wake_chrome.sh` (`osascript`),
every script, and above all the **Chrome extension — which is the candidate's own logged-in browser** — all
live on the Mac. Scheduled tasks are documented as running only *"while this app is open"*, i.e.
the desktop app.

So a coordinator session that cannot reach the Mac can **decide**, but it cannot **act**.

This is the queue for the gap — the mirror of `data/inbox.jsonl`:

    data/inbox.jsonl            background run  →  coordinator     "here is what I found"
    data/pending_actions.jsonl  coordinator     →  laptop run      "here is what needs your hands"

## ⛔ WHAT THIS QUEUE MUST NEVER CARRY: A SEND

**Deliberately excluded, and this is the important part of the answer.** CLAUDE.md's standing rule
is *"NEVER send messages, emails, or applications without the candidate's explicit fresh approval."* **A
send queued now and executed by an unattended run three hours later is not fresh approval** — it is
approval-at-a-distance for an irreversible, outward-facing act. Building that would quietly convert
a hard rule into a soft one.

**And the constraint bites far less than it looks**, because the candidate sends everything directly anyway.
When Claude has sent a LinkedIn message it was always *"on the candidate's explicit in-session instruction"*,
with them present at that moment. That workflow simply requires the laptop and their attention
together — which is exactly what it required before this queue existed.

**So what belongs here is laptop-bound work that is SAFE unattended and REVERSIBLE:** a contact-path
lookup, a reply/degree check, reading a JD an ATS won't render to a plain fetch, a profile read.
Research and reads. Never a send, never an application, never a profile edit.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/deferred.py                       # what is waiting for the laptop
    python3 scripts/deferred.py --add "<what>" --why "<why it needs the laptop>"
    python3 scripts/deferred.py --done <id>

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.
