"""
Audit the PROFILE / ENGINE separation — and, more importantly, detect DRIFT between
`config.json` and the numbers restated in prose.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-08-02 `config.json` was created to segment the candidate's data from the reusable
machinery. The candidate then asked the right question: *"is it clear the files that support
the agents and processes are distinctly separate to the user data?"*

Measured honestly, the answer was **no** — 348 user-data references still sat inside
engine files, and the comp tiers now existed in **two** places: `config.json` AND
~400 words of CLAUDE.md prose. **That is strictly worse than one place**, because two
sources of truth can disagree and nothing would notice. The whole point of extracting
the profile was to stop a screening rule drifting; duplicating it re-opens that door.

**The candidate's ruling (2026-08-02): "The json are suppose to be the sources of truth."** So the
fix is NOT to keep the two copies in agreement — it is to have only ONE copy. The first
version of this script checked that CLAUDE.md's numbers MATCHED profile.json, which
quietly treated the prose as a co-equal source. Inverted per the candidate: the engine must
contain **no comp values at all**. Every figure, quote, and rationale was moved into
`config.json` (nothing was deleted — the verbatim the candidate quotes live in the tier notes),
and CLAUDE.md now points at `scripts/profile.py` instead of restating anything.

  * DUPLICATION CHECK (an ERROR, exits 1) — a comp value appearing anywhere in an ENGINE
    file is a second source of truth and fails this check.
  * LEAKAGE REPORT (informational) — how much user data sits in engine files, which
    is the honest measure of how packageable the engine is for a second user.

Two different questions, deliberately separated:
    "Is the user's data in one place?"      -> mostly yes (profile.json + resume/data)
    "Is the ENGINE free of user data?"      -> no, and this quantifies the gap

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_profile_leakage.py            # report + drift check
    python3 scripts/check_profile_leakage.py --strict   # exit 1 on drift (default is also 1)
    python3 scripts/check_profile_leakage.py --report   # leakage report only, exit 0

Python 3.9+. Standard library only.

# This block used to hardcode the owner's first name, three home cities, two email handles, four
# employers — and a REAL PHONE NUMBER, spelled as a regex so a phone-shaped search would not find
# it. The leak detector was the largest concentration of personal data in the engine, and it is
# in all 55 commits of this repository's history, from the first one.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT ONLY EVER GUARDED ONE PERSON. Installed by anyone else, it watched for a stranger's
# name and cities and was blind to their own — a gate that reports CLEAN while protecting nothing,
# which is this project's defining failure shape, sitting inside the check written to prevent it.
#
# So the terms are derived from the profile at runtime. Each installation guards ITS OWN identity,
# and the engine carries none. This is the repo's own rule — `config.json`/`user.json` hold the
