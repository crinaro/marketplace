"""Enforce the section invariants against the stores that feed the generated dashboard.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-20)
----------------------------
The candidate: "it doesn't seem like we have clear rules when something is categorized in
a specific area. why is something on 'Your Move' when it's already setup
(meetings are an example)".

The cause was mechanical: resolved items were being REWRITTEN IN PLACE as "✅ CONFIRMED ..."
status lines instead of being deleted, and the same subject sat in two panels at once.

⭐ WHAT CHANGED IN 0.25.0 (dev #93 / public #21)
------------------------------------------------
This used to parse `focus.md`, because that file was where the ask lists were hand-written.
focus.md is retired as a source of state: the asks live in `data/asks.jsonl`, the scheduled
commitments in `data/commitments.jsonl`, and the dashboard renders those stores directly. So
the invariants are now enforced AGAINST THE STORES — the render is a pure function of them,
so a clean store IS a clean surface, and checking prose nobody hand-writes any more would
check nothing. What each historic rule became:

  1. RESOLVED ITEM IN AN ASK LIST — an OPEN ask (no `resolved_on`) whose text reads as
     settled ("✅", "CONFIRMED", "done", ...). The store's own resolution mechanism is
     `resolved_on` + `resolution`; prose-resolving a row keeps it rendering forever, which
     is the exact staleness the cutover exists to end.
  2. ONE ITEM, ONE SECTION — (a) two open asks about the same subject (the render puts each
     row in exactly one group, so the only duplicate left is two ROWS); (b) an open ask that
     duplicates a scheduled commitment — a commitment is not an ask, and This Week is its
     only home; (c) an ask duplicating a role the JSONL already routes to Your Move by
     `next_action_owner` — the derived row renders anyway, so the ask is a second copy.
  3. ASK SHAPE — an open ask must read as a question or an imperative aimed at the owner.
     ⭐ AND THE DERIVED HALF OF THE PANEL (dev/audit 2026-09-02, public #43): the Your Move
     panel is open asks PLUS role rows derived from opportunities.jsonl (your_move.py's
     `now`/`decide` groups), and this check used to read only the asks — so it reported
     clean having seen half the panel. A derived row's text is its `next_action`; here it
     is held to rule 1 (no resolved text on a row still routed to the owner) and to a
     weaker shape rule (a `now` row must HAVE an action — an empty one is a decision
     nobody made, rendered as "No next action set"). The full ASK_SHAPES vocabulary is
     deliberately not applied to `next_action`: it is a memo field, and most real
     imperatives there match none of the ask phrases. The footer states how many of
     each half were checked, so a clean report can never again mean "checked the asks".
  4. WRONG-DOMAIN — kind=role text that is plainly a system/tooling decision, or
     kind=system text that is plainly a role decision. `kind` picks the panel, so a wrong
     kind is the modern form of "system item in Your Move".
  5. UNRESOLVED COMMITMENT DATE — a commitment whose date is the migration marker
     `unresolved` is surfaced here too; an unreadable date is an unknown, never a pass.
  6. NUMERIC CROSS-REFERENCE ROT — now checked in `handoff.md` (the surviving hand-written
     narrative): "Your Move #4" goes stale the instant a generated list reorders.

Advisory only: always exits 0, so it can never wedge an unattended run.
