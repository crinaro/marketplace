"""
Multi-account Gmail MCP server (stdio, JSON-RPC 2.0) — pure standard library.

⭐ THIS IS THE `gmail-multi` CONNECTOR PLUGIN — STANDALONE BY REQUIREMENT.
It must work with nothing else installed: no other plugin, no profile directory,
no environment inherited from a shell. Its configuration is its own
(`~/.claude/gmail-multi/accounts.json`, below), and a consumer plugin that wants
to feed it accounts writes THAT file — never the other way round. This module
must never import a consumer's code or resolve a consumer's data directory.
(It was extracted from the jobsearch plugin, 2026-08-20 — ADR-004 in the
marketplace repo records the extraction and the compatibility constants.)

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The claude.ai-managed Gmail connector OAuth-binds to ONE Google account. Real
correspondence often spans several:

    you@example.com       (Google Workspace)
    you@gmail.com         (consumer)

A thread living entirely on the OTHER account is invisible to every search that
covers one mailbox — and an empty result from a half-covered search looks
exactly like "no such message". That silent shape has cost real, measurable
misses; this server exists to make it structurally impossible.

DESIGN RULE THAT MATTERS MOST
-----------------------------
`account` defaults to "all". Every result is tagged with the mailbox it came
from — never conclude a message doesn't exist from a search that covered one
mailbox. Defaulting to "all" makes that structural rather than something the
model has to remember.

Corollary: a missing credential is a LOUD error naming the account, never an
empty result set. And a server with NO accounts configured refuses loudly,
naming the fix — it never serves an empty result that reads as "no mail".

WHY IMAP AND NOT THE GMAIL API
------------------------------
An OAuth app in "Testing" publishing status has refresh tokens that expire every
7 days, so it would break weekly. Escaping that requires publishing to
production, and gmail.readonly is a RESTRICTED scope, which triggers Google
verification + a security assessment. An "Internal" Workspace app avoids
verification but cannot cover a consumer account like a personal gmail.com address.

IMAP has no expiry treadmill, needs no OAuth app, preserves full Gmail query
syntax through the X-GM-RAW extension, and — unlike the managed connector —
can actually FETCH ATTACHMENTS.

CREDENTIALS
-----------
App passwords live in the OS credential store (Keychain / PasswordVault /
secret-service via scripts/credentials.py) and are read at call time. They are
never stored on disk by this plugin, never passed as command-line arguments
(that would put them in shell history / process listings), and never logged.
`python3 scripts/accounts.py --status` prints the exact store command for your
platform; on macOS it is:

    security add-generic-password -a you@example.com -s claudesearch-imap -w

(omitting a value after -w makes `security` prompt interactively, so the secret
never touches the shell history)

Python 3.9+. No third-party packages, by design.

# Accounts this server searches. Emails only — never secrets.
#
# ⭐ THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS THE CONNECTOR'S OWN CONFIG FILE, read at call time:
#
#     ~/.claude/gmail-multi/accounts.json        (override path: GMAIL_MULTI_CONFIG)
#     {
#       "accounts": ["you@example.com"],         literal addresses, and/or
#       "include":  ["/abs/path/to/some.json"]   files whose addresses are merged in
#     }
#
# An `include` entry lets a CONSUMER plugin delegate rather than copy: jobsearch points an
# include at its profile's user.json, so a mailbox added there reaches this server on the
# next call with no second bookkeeping. Each included file may carry `"accounts": [...]`,
# or `"mailboxes"` as either a list of {"address": ...} objects or a dict keyed by address
# (both shapes exist in the wild). ⚠️ An include that cannot be read or parsed is a LOUD
# error naming the path — never a silently shorter account list, because partial coverage
# reads as "no mail" (the 2026-08-05 zero-mailboxes incident, which this design replaces).
#
# Resolution order: GMAIL_MCP_ACCOUNTS env override -> the config file -> AccountsError.
# ⭐ THERE IS NO FALLBACK LIST, BY DESIGN. A hardcoded fallback made an earlier version of
# this server person-specific, and an EMPTY fallback made "unconfigured" indistinguishable
# from "no mail". Unconfigured raises AccountsError naming the exact fix.
#
# HOME-anchored, not cwd- or env-anchored, because an MCP server is spawned by the Claude
# runtime with no useful cwd and no shell environment. A durable path under ~/.claude is
# the only thing such a process can rely on.
